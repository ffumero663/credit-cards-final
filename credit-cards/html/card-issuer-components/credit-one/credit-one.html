      <h3>Credit One Bank American Express® Card: Best for fair credit</h3>
      <p><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> This is a solid, low-cost card for those with fair credit looking to strengthen their overall credit health. <a href="#">Credit One and American Express have paired</a> to offer low fees and a straightforward rewards structure of unlimited 1% cash back on all purchases (terms apply). Its simplicity gives this card a lot of value.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Pros:</strong> This card gives the opportunity to raise your credit line based on your overall credit performance and free access to your Experian credit score, two useful tools for <a href="#">improving your credit score</a>. Plus, if you’re interested in applying, but worried about your credit taking a hit due to uncertain approval odds, you can check online to see if you prequalify with no impact to your credit score.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Cons:</strong> The card comes with a pretty high regular APR, making it extra important to be sure you avoid carrying a balance. The card also comes with an annual fee of $39, so you can find more affordable, more rewarding cards if your credit score allows it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Who should apply?</strong> Those looking for consistent rewards from a card that can help you get started on the path to a good credit score should consider this option.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Who should skip?</strong> A fee-averse shopper may want to check out their <a href="#">no annual fee options</a> before committing to this card’s $39 yearly price tag.</p>

<p><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> This card offers a lavish rewards structure that’s hard to beat among other credit-building cards: Earn 5% cash back rewards on eligible gas, grocery, internet, cable, TV, and cell service purchases (up to the first $5,000 in purchases per year, then 1%).</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> You still earn 1% cash back on purchases that don’t fit the bonus categories (terms apply), making every eligible swipe worth something. Plus, you’ll get a whopping 10% cash back through <a href="#">Credit One’s More Rewards Program</a>, which is a card-linked offer program. On top of the rewards, you can check if you pre-qualify online and track your credit score with free access through Experian.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Your earnings at the 5% rate are limited to $5,000 of purchases per year, then will go to 1%. Also, the card’s regular APR is pretty high, and it comes with a $95 annual fee.</p>

<p><strong>Who should apply?</strong> If you foresee yourself spending largely in the high-rate categories, this card can offer big benefits to your everyday shopping. To take full advantage of all this card has to offer, keep a close eye on rewards opportunities through the More Rewards Program, and you could easily negate the annual fee.</p>

<p><strong>Who should skip?</strong> Someone with great credit looking for a high cash back rate might want to explore their other options. There may be a card with more lenient limits on your bonus cash back.</p>

<h3>Credit One Bank® Platinum Visa® for Rebuilding Credit: Best for bad credit</h3>
<p><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> If you have a bad or <a href="#">fair credit score</a>, it can be difficult to find a well-rounded card in your credit range. Luckily, this card accepts a generous range of credit scores (300 to 670), allows you to check if you prequalify, doesn’t require a security deposit, and comes with valuable perks.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> There’s no set schedule, but your account will be automatically reviewed for credit line increases – an essential to improving your <a href="#">credit utilization</a> (and your credit score). To regularly track your score, you’ll have access to a free Experian credit score and report summary every month. Cardholders also earn 1% cash back on eligible gas, grocery, mobile phone service, internet, cable, and satellite TV purchases (terms apply).</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The card starts with a low credit limit at just $300, and if you were to carry a balance, you’d face a high APR. The annual fee is $75 the first year and $99 in subsequent years ($8.25 per month). If you have good or better credit, you can likely be accepted for a more valuable card with better rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Who should apply?</strong> This option’s ease of approval, credit-building benefits, and cash back rewards make it a good starter card for those trying to climb towards good or excellent credit.</p>

<p><strong>Who should skip?</strong> An experienced cardholder capable of being approved for a friendlier APR and annual-fee structure should explore other card options.</p>

<h3>Credit One Bank® Platinum Rewards Visa® with No Annual Fee: Best for no annual fee</h3>
<p><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> You can track your credit score online with a free Experian credit report each month and have your account regularly reviewed for a credit limit increase with this card. There’s also no penalty APR for a late payment and some lucrative rewards available, all for no annual fee.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Cardholders get 2% cash back on eligible purchases at grocery stores and gas stations, as well as cellphone, internet, and cable and satellite television services. Plus, the Credit One’s More Rewards Program can take the value of these rewards up a notch, boosting them by as much as 10% from participating merchants. Potential cardholders can also check for pre-qualification ahead of time to see if they’ll have access to things like zero fraud liability and a flexible payment schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> You’ll want to avoid carrying a balance month to month due to this card’s high APR. It also comes with a $1,000 credit limit which is generous for a credit building card. Managing a budget and tracking your spending will help salvage your score in the long term.</p>

<p><strong>Who should apply?</strong> Thanks to its widespread rewards and no annual fee, this is a great everyday-use card for those looking for a cash back and credit-building combination.</p>

<p><strong>Who should skip?</strong> Someone who knows they’ll have to carry a balance may want to avoid this card’s steep APR and look to <a href="#">0% APR cards</a> for a solution.</p>

<h3>Credit One Bank® Platinum Visa®: Best for cash back</h3>
<p><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> You’ll earn unlimited 1% cash back on all eligible gas, cell phone, internet, grocery store, cable and satellite TV purchases, plus have access to free online credit monitoring and a flexible payment schedule while avoiding an annual fee.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> This card gives access to many perks, including fraud protection, automatic account reviews for credit increases, and discounts from participating retailers through Credit One’s More Rewards. You can also set up custom payment reminders to be certain you don’t fall behind on bills.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> While the cash back earnings are nice for a starter card and those trying to improve poor credit, you can find more rewarding options elsewhere. It also features a short initial credit limit at $300 and a high APR.</p>

<p><strong>Who should apply?</strong> While some of the other cards here may have more to offer, this is still a viable option for newcomers and those trying to grow their credit score thanks to its consistent rewards and perks to help credit building.</p>

<p><strong>Who should skip?</strong> If you’re looking for some flexibility with how much you can spend, you may want to look elsewhere. This card’s starting credit limit of $300 doesn’t allow for a high budget or low credit utilization.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-credit-one-section">What is Credit One Bank?</h3>
<p>Credit One Bank describes itself as “a technology and data-driven financial services company” that started as a single-standing full-service bank in 1984. Since then, it has quickly grown into one of the top credit card issuers in the country, acquiring millions of accounts. As one of the largest issuers in the United States, Credit One Bank distributed $7.75 million in 2020 charitable donations and over $172 million in cash back rewards paid.</p>
<p>The bank offers an array of different cards and structures, but the majority of its products appear to be designed with a certain type of customer in mind. Consumers in the fair to good credit range looking to be rewarded shouldn’t overlook the best Credit One credit cards thanks to their cash-back generosity and the ability to grow your credit. As the bank continues to grow, Credit One has also become the official credit card for large sports teams and corporations, such as NASCAR, the Big 12 Conference, and Las Vegas’ hometown squads, the Raiders and Golden Knights.</p>
<p>Credit One strives to help their customers improve financially, offering a plethora of resources for <a href="#">credit building, financial education and credit basics.</a> In addition, Credit One offers advice such as <a href="#">“5 Ways to Help Pay Down Debt” and “How to Improve Your Credit Score- 5 Quick Methods”</a>, useful resources for continuing or starting your credit-building journey.</p>

<h3 id="choose-a-card-section">How to choose the right card for you</h3>
<p>When choosing a credit card, start by evaluating where you stand financially and ask yourself what you want out of a card. By using a tool like <a href="#">CardMatch</a>, you can sift through your personalized offers based on your credit profile with ease and may find Credit One cards in your range.</p>
<p>Credit One provides a multitude of options that can help your credit score grow, and while other high-end credit cards may have flashier benefits and rewards structures, here you can find better than average rewards structures for those with less than stellar credit. To compare between Credit One cards, consider how the rewards categories, fees, APRs and credit-building benefits directly apply to your lifestyle before making a decision. For select customers, the final call could be a bit easier.</p>
