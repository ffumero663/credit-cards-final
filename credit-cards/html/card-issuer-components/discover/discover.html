            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>A few competitors earn higher rewards rates in similar categories, including the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express and the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express.</li>

            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You don’t necessarily need a stellar credit score or extensive credit history to apply. The recommended credit score for this card is fair (580 to 669 FICO, 601-660 VantageScore).</li>
              <li>Although you should always pay your credit card bill on time and in full, this card does offer a little cushion (including no late fee for the first time you miss a payment, up to $41 after that).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Although you’ll earn 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants, the rate drops to 1% after you spend $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter. The only category where you earn unlimited cash back (1%) is the catch-all “other eligible purchases.”</li>
              <li>If you’re looking for fancy perks, you won’t find them here. This card profiles as everyday, not extravagant.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>The card reports to all three major credit bureaus, unlike some cards that report to only two. Reporting to all three bureaus means that responsible credit habits will have a wider positive effect on your credit score and credit history.</li>
              <li>Starting at seven months, Discover will review your account to see if you might qualify for an upgrade to an unsecured line of credit and a deposit refund.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The security deposit ($200 minimum) is higher than some competitor cards. Although good credit habits could lead to a full refund eventually, paying $200 upfront might not be ideal for everybody.</li>
              <li>This card’s regular APR is above average for typical credit cards. With this card, carrying an unpaid balance could cost you a lot more in interest charges.</li>

            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The bonus categories tend to cover practical, everyday purchases that won’t be out of your way as a consumer, including gas stations, grocery stores and restaurants.</li>
              <li>Low cost of ownership is a trademark feature of Discover cards, which translates to no annual fees, no foreign transaction fees and more.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Managing the bonus categories, activating every quarter and targeting your spending does require more maintenance than you’d have with a simple, flat-rate card.</li>
              <li>The 5% bonus rate applies only to the first $1,500 in rotating category purchases per quarter, after which it drops to 1%. If you spend a lot in a particular category year-round, a fixed-rate card with unlimited earnings could be more lucrative.</li>

            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The bonus categories are everyday, not obscure. The typical Discover cash back calendar includes categories such as restaurants, grocery stores.</li>
              <li>This card is low on fees which is great for someone new to credit. There is no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees and no penalty APR.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The management aspect of the rotating bonus categories isn’t for everyone. Unless you commit to activating every quarter and adjusting your spending habits in those areas, you won’t get the card’s full value.</li>
              <li>The 5% bonus rate applies only to the first $1,500 in rotating category purchases per quarter, after which it drops to 1%.</li>
              <li>Avoid carrying a balance whenever possible (on this card or any card) since the high end of the APR range could make carrying a balance a challenge.</li>

              <li>You don’t necessarily need a stellar credit score or extensive credit history to apply. The recommended credit score for this card is fair (580 to 669 FICO, 601-660 VantageScore).</li>
              <li>Although you should always pay your credit card bill on time and in full, this card does offer a little cushion (including no late fee for the first time you miss a payment, up to $41 after that).</li>

            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Although you’ll earn 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants, the rate drops to 1% after you spend $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter. The only category where you earn unlimited cash back (1%) is the catch-all “other eligible purchases.”</li>
              <li>If you’re looking for fancy perks, you won’t find them here. This card profiles as everyday, not extravagant.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The card reports to all three major credit bureaus, unlike some cards that report to only two. Reporting to all three bureaus means that responsible credit habits will have a wider positive effect on your credit score and credit history.</li>
                <li>Starting at seven months, Discover will review your account to see if you might qualify for an upgrade to an unsecured line of credit and a deposit refund.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The security deposit ($200 minimum) is higher than some competitor cards. Although good credit habits could lead to a full refund eventually, paying $200 upfront might not be ideal for everybody.</li>
                <li>This card's regular APR is above average for typical credit cards. With this card, carrying an unpaid balance could cost you a lot more in interest charges.</li>

            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The rewards program makes it easy to earn Miles even when you’re not actually traveling. A fill-up at the gas station earns rewards at the same rate as the purchase of a round-trip airline ticket.</li>
              <li>There’s no foreign transaction fee, which is ideal for a travel card. Your international purchases won’t be subject to currency conversion charges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>As much as you may appreciate simplicity, a higher-grade travel credit card does offer some advantages. They typically include higher rewards rates, automatic membership in loyalty programs and richer travel perks.</li>
              <li>If you take the card abroad, remember that Discover’s payment network has less broad coverage than those of Visa, Mastercard and American Express.</li>

            <h3>Bottom Line</h3>

              <li>This card is low on fees, which is great for someone new to credit. There is no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees and no penalty APR.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The management aspect of the rotating bonus categories isn’t for everyone. Unless you commit to activating every quarter and adjusting your spending habits in those areas, you won’t get the card’s full value.</li>
              <li>Avoid carrying a balance whenever possible (on this card or any card) since the high end of the APR range could make carrying a balance a challenge.</li>

            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You don’t necessarily need a stellar credit score or extensive credit history to apply. The recommended credit score for this card is fair (580 to 669 FICO, 601-660 VantageScore).</li>
              <li>Although you should always pay your credit card bill on time and in full, this card does offer a little cushion (including no late fee for the first time you miss a payment, up to $41 after that).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Although you’ll earn 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants, the rate drops to 1% after you spend $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter. The only category where you earn unlimited cash back (1%) is the catch-all “other eligible purchases.”</li>
              <li>If you’re looking for fancy perks, you won’t find them here. This card profiles as everyday, not extravagant.</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="bottom-line">
            <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
            <p>The Discover it® Student Chrome is a potentially lucrative way to help you get something back for the money you spend at the pump and on the menu.</p>

        <h3>Best for cash back on rotating categories: Discover it® Cash Back</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> <a href="#">Discover’s first-year Cashback Match™</a> matches all of the cash back you accumulate at the end of year one. This could easily beat the sign-up bonuses offered by many other rewards cards. Plus, the card’s lengthy introductory purchase APR offer allows you to earn cash back on larger purchases and pay them off over time.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You must enroll in a rotating bonus category every quarter to maximize your cash back, and quarterly categories may not always line up with your spending habits.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Chase Freedom Flex®</a> also has quarterly rotation categories but also has categories that earn increased rates all year. This includes dining, drugstores, and travel booked through Chase Travel<sup>SM</sup>.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re on the hunt for a generous cash back bonus at the end of the first year and don’t mind keeping up with rotating categories, this user-friendly card stands out from the pack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Discover it® Cash Back review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for travelers: Discover it® Miles</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Thanks to the card’s first-year mile match offer, you’ll effectively earn 3X miles on every purchase for the first 12 months (1.5X miles on purchases, matched at the end of your first year).</li>
    
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card lacks a traditional sign-up bonus, so you’ll have to spend a decent amount to get much value out of the first-year match. Also, since you can’t transfer your miles to frequent-flier programs, the card isn’t ideal if you’re loyal to specific airlines.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The benefits packed into the <a href="#">Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card</a> will offset the $95 annual fee for many travelers looking to maximize the amount of rewards they earn.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Discover it® Miles is a decent choice for people who travel on a budget. But anyone who wants to maximize how much cash back they earn or travelers looking for premium perks will get more value with another card.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Discover it® Miles review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for students earning cash back: Discover it® Student Cash Back</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You won’t have to sacrifice top-notch cash back rewards just because you’re a student. You’ll earn 5% cash back in rotating categories like gas, groceries and restaurants (with enrollment, up to $1,500 per quarter, then 1% back). Plus, Discover will match all the cash back you earn at the end of your first year.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You’ll have the added homework of enrolling in a rotating bonus category every quarter to maximize your cash back, and the card’s variable APR, though reasonable, is a bit higher than that of many student cards, so you’ll have to be diligent about paying off your balance in full each month.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> earns an unlimited 3% cash back all year round in student-friendly areas, such as grocery stores (excluding superstores like Walmart and Target), dining, entertainment and popular streaming services.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Discover it® Student Cash Back is ideal for responsible students who won’t carry a balance and feel capable of keeping track of rotating categories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Discover it® Student Cash Back review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for gas and dining rewards: Discover it® Chrome</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> It offers 2% cash back on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter (then 1%) on spending at gas stations and restaurants. When matched at the end of the first year, this is a remarkable rate for a no-annual-fee card.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> While the card’s low-end APR can be significantly lower than the average cash back card APR, your APR could run quite high if you have some blemishes on your credit history.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Citi Double Cash® Card</a> offers 2% cash back on all of your purchases: 1% when you make purchases and another 1% as you pay the balance for those purchases.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you like to eat out or do a lot of driving, this well-rounded everyday card can earn big rewards in addition to an already generous welcome offer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Discover it® Chrome review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for students: Discover it® Student Chrome</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The card’s consumer-friendly terms are great for someone new to credit: You won’t be charged a late fee the first time you miss a payment and you won’t get hit with a penalty APR if you end up falling behind more frequently. You should note that there is a late payment fee of up to $41 after the first time you pay late.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card’s introductory APR is only for new purchases and only lasts for a few months.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> provides a flat rate of 1.5% on all of your purchases compared to the Student Chrome’s 2% at gas stations and restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined quarterly purchases, then 1% (1% cash back on all other purchases).</li>
    
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Discover’s easy-to-use account management tools are great for first-time student cardholders looking to establish healthy credit habits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Discover it® Student Chrome review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for cash back and credit building: Discover it® Secured Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You can build credit without putting down a lot of money upfront as a deposit. Even better, Discover promises to review your account on a monthly basis starting at seven months to see if you qualify for an upgrade to an unsecured line of credit and return your deposit.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> A low security deposit means a low credit limit, which may have a negative impact on your <a href="#">credit utilization</a>.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Petal® 2 “Cash Back, No Fees” Visa® Credit Card</a> doesn’t require a security deposit, and you could earn up to 1.5% cash back on all eligible purchases.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Credit-builders who don’t love the idea of putting down a deposit to grow their score should look to <a href="#">student credit cards</a> or <a href="#">credit cards for bad credit</a>.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-discover-section">What is Disover?</h3>
<p>Discover is best known for its stellar lineup of cash back cards, but it is more than just a card issuer. Discover is also a network, along with <a href="#">Visa</a>, <a href="#">Mastercard</a> and <a href="#">American Express</a>. This means it partners with merchants nationally and worldwide, making Discover cards viable payment across numerous countries.</p>
<p>Discover offers several more financial services as well, such as online banking, student loans, home loans and personal loans. They also offer their customers useful add-ons, like a free look at your <a href="#">FICO score</a> and identity theft protection. These connections and services have made Discover a top provider of cards for cash back, everyday earnings, small businesses, beginners and more.</p>


<h3>Where is Discover accepted?</h3>
<p>Despite being the smallest major U.S. network, Discover is still widely accepted by 99% of merchants who accept credit cards. It’s also accepted in 200 countries and territories. With widespread acceptance both in the states and around the globe, Discover’s cards can be great travel companions. If you’re planning a trip, you can check the <a href="#">Discover Card International Acceptance Map</a> to see if your card is good-to-go.</p>

<h3 id="credit-score-needed-section">What credit score is needed for a Discover credit card?</h3>
<p>Some of Discover’s cards will require a credit score in the good or excellent range, meaning your score will likely need to be at least 670 for their top choices. That being said, Discover has options for everyone no matter the credit score.</p>
<p>Discover’s <a href="#">secured cards</a> and <a href="#">student cards</a> are more than just a backup plan for cardholders with poor credit. They’re some of the most well-rounded and rewarding cards of their kind. After setting a trend of good habits with one of those starter cards, you can <a href="#">grow your credit score</a> and move on to a Discover card that features better benefits.</p>

<h3 id="choose-a-card-section">How to choose a Discover credit card</h3>
<p>Discover offers a variety of cards: credit building, student, travel and cash back cards. To find the one right for you, it’s a good idea to take a look at your own spending habits and identify the type of consumer you are. Using our <a href="#">CardMatch tool</a> can help narrow down your options before applying and give you an idea of the right card for you based on your credit profile.</p>

    <h3>Who should get a Discover credit card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The occasional traveler.</strong> If you are an occasional traveler who needs room for flexibility, the Discover it® Miles is one of the <a href="#">best travel credit cards</a>. This card earns 1.5X miles on all types of spending, with no blackout dates on redemption.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The student consumer.</strong> Discover has two student cards: the Discover it® Student Cash Back and the Discover it® Student Chrome. These are good cards for students with no credit history who want to experiment with rewards and build credit in the meantime. They also both feature an introductory APR on purchases.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Who Should Skip a Discover Card Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should skip a Discover credit card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The luxury traveler.</strong> Someone looking for a top-notch travel experience including comped checked bags, access to airport lounges, priority upgrades, and anything else exclusive to the high-priced lifestyle will have to look to other <a href="#">travel cards</a>. Cards with high annual fees can often be your ticket into these offers, and can be very much worth the cost for the right spender.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The quick-bonus chaser.</strong> If you’re someone trying to capitalize on credit card rewards in the near future, cards with more traditional sign-up bonuses might be a better choice. Discover’s rewards cards are typically backed with their Cashback Match offer, which – while valuable – takes a full year to make an impact.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="programs-section">What programs does Discover offer?</h2>
<p>As a top provider for customer satisfaction, Discover gives ways for their cardholders to earn great rewards and benefits. Knowing their featured programs can help you take full advantage of their offers and level-up as a cardholder.</p>

<h3>Discover’s rotating cash back</h3>
<p><a href="#">Discover’s 2023 Cashback Calendar</a> is available. To ensure you earn the full cash back rate, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You must activate the bonus each quarter to receive 5% back.</li>
    <li>Your bonus is active from the first day of the first month of each quarter – or the date on which you activate it, whichever is later – through the last day of the last month of each quarter.</li>
    <li>You earn bonus cash back up to the quarterly maximum of $1,500 in purchases.</li>
    <li>All spending over the quarterly maximum and all purchases outside a quarter’s bonus category earn 1% cash back.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discover’s reward redemption options</h3>
<p>Since cash back reward values are pretty straightforward, the <a href="#">best cash back redemption options</a> are often the most convenient for you at the moment without sacrificing reward value. For gift card lovers, however, Discover has a great deal: There is an added value on each gift card you redeem for (for example, certain merchants offer a $25 gift card for $20 of cash back rewards).</p>

<p>When you’re ready to collect your hard-earned Discover credit card rewards, here’s a quick rundown of your <a href="#">Discover redemption options</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cash</strong>, either as a direct deposit or a statement credit – 1 cent minimum redemption</li>
    <li><strong>Amazon.com purchases</strong>, using the “Cashback Bonus®” option at checkout ($1 Cashback Bonus = $1) – no minimum redemption value</li>
    <li><strong>Gift cards</strong> (with an added bonus value) – ranging from $5 – $200 in increments of $5 (minimum redemption)</li>
    <li><strong>Charity donations</strong> – 1 cent minimum redemption</li>
</ul>

<p>Discover it Miles can be redeemed as a credit toward eligible travel purchases on your credit card statement or as a bank account direct deposit, both at 1 cent per 1 mile. Plus, Discover’s cash back and miles don’t expire. Rather than erasing your rewards, Discover will credit your account with your cash back or miles balance if your account is closed or it hasn’t been used within 18 months.</p>




<h3 id="discover-card-worth-it-section">Is a Discover credit card worth it?</h3>
<p>Being a known leader in the credit cards industry, it should come as no surprise that Discover provides worthwhile card offers with strong rewards. Whether your goal is to accumulate cash back, use your spending to flip into a vacation or get a card to build your credit score and unlock new opportunities, Discover has a no-annual-fee card that can bring you value.</p>
<p>The top way Discover helps their cardholders is by offering top-notch cash back rates along with a generous welcome offer. You can get  5% cash back in rotating categories each quarter upon enrollment (up to the quarterly max, then 1%) and double it thanks to Discover in the first year. You can also take advantage of that same matching offer with their number of cards that earn 2% back at gas stations and restaurants (on up to $1,000 combined purchases quarterly, then 1%), giving rewards opportunities to cardholders no matter their score.</p>
<p>Looking at Discover’s number of benefits is an easy way to evaluate whether one of their cards is worth it to you, but matching your spending habits to their rewards offers is the best way to be sure any card is worthwhile. It may take a little extra work to get the most out of a Discover card, as you may have to activate rotating bonus categories and pay close attention to your spending  throughout the year, but a savvy shopper will find one of their cards very worthwhile. In any case, squeezing maximum value out of your Discover card will require you to know how to manage your spending and take advantage of the top redemption options.</p>

      <p>If you’re looking for a card that can help you build credit and show responsible financial behavior, one of the following cards could be the right fit for you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Discover it® Secured Credit Card</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Discover it® Student Cash Back</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Discover it® Student Chrome</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h5>What is the average credit limit on a Discover card?</h5>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Discover doesn’t provide information about average credit limits. According to data from <a href="#">Experian</a>, the average credit limit for Americans is $30,365 across all their credit cards. But individual credit limits vary widely.</p>

      <p>A number of Discover cardholders revealed their credit limits on a <a href="#">myFICO forum</a>. Some reported limits as low as $300, while others reported limits that soared into the thousands. These variances show that the average credit limit for a Discover card is less important than knowing the factors that go into determining your individual credit limit. These include income, credit score, and the information contained in your credit report.</p>

      <p>Your credit score can give you a quick idea of <a href="#">a good credit limit</a>. The <a href="#">American Banking Association</a> notes that an average credit limit for someone with a super-prime credit score (759 or higher) is $9,329, while a prime credit score (between 680 to 759) has an average credit limit of $5,109, and subprime scores (680 and below) have an average limit of $2,541.</p>

      <h5>What is the minimum payment on a Discover card?</h5>

    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>The smallest total amount you will owe on a Discover card each month depends on your creditworthiness and the terms of your <a href="#">cardmember agreement</a>.</p>

<p>For Discover cardmembers with excellent credit, the minimum payment due will be any past due balance plus one of the following (whichever is greater):</p>
<ul>
    <li>$35</li>
    <li>2% of the new balance shown on your billing statement</li>
    <li>$20, plus any interest charges, late fees or fees for any debt protection product as shown on your billing statement.</li>
</ul>

<p>For people working on their credit or who have the Discover it® Secured Credit Card, your minimum payment will at least be $20, but it could be higher.</p>

<p>According to a sample <a href="#">cardmember agreement for a secured credit card account</a>, if you have a past due balance, you’ll owe that plus the greater of the following: 3% of the new balance (minus interest charges and late fees shown on your billing statement) or $15 plus any interest charges, late fees (not to exceed 4% of the new balance), or fees for any debt protection product.</p>
