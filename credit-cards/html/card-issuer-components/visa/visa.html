  <h3>Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card: Best for routine Southwest flyers</h3>

<p><strong>Best features:</strong> This is a solid airline credit card, offering frequent Southwest flyers a generous sign-up bonus, a decent anniversary bonus, baggage fee waivers and bonus points on Southwest flights and purchases with the airline’s car rental and hotel partners. You redeem rewards in various ways, including for airfare, gift cards, merchandise, car rentals, cruises and hotel stays.</p>

<p><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Unlike many travel or airline credit cards, this card charges a 3% foreign transaction fee, so it’s not suited for international travel. Southwest, in general, has limited options for international travel. You can only book rewards flights on Southwest; the airline does not have airline partners.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives:</strong> This is a card for Southwest flyers, so if you don’t fly with the carrier, consider a different airline or general-purpose travel card like the <a href="#">Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card</a>. With the Sapphire Preferred, you get a list of major airline partners as well as perks like an annual hotel credit, making it a well-rounded card.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re looking for a Southwest rewards credit card but don’t want to shoulder a high annual fee, this card is your best bet as it charges the lowest annual fee ($69) in the Rapid Rewards line up.</p>

<h3>Credit One Bank® Platinum Rewards Visa® with No Annual Fee: Best for building credit</h3>

<p><strong>Best features:</strong> Cardholders enjoy 2% cash back on eligible purchases at grocery stores and gas stations, as well as cellphone, internet, and cable and satellite television services. Potential cardholders can also check for prequalification ahead of time to gauge their approval options. Also, there’s no penalty APR for a late payment and some lucrative rewards are available.</p>

<p><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Although the $300 credit limit is meant to help new cardholders, this short limit could hurt your credit score through your utilization ratio. Prioritizing good credit habits will give you the ability to increase your limit and help salvage your score in the long-term. Also, the card’s variable APR is high, so it’s in cardholders’ best interest to avoid carrying a balance month to month.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Someone with an established credit score and the ability to take their pick from a catalog of <a href="#">rewards cards</a> would likely benefit more from another card. The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</a> is a great option for those with a good credit score or higher (a FICO score of 670 or higher). It earns 2 percent cash rewards on purchases and has no annual fee.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Thanks to its well-rounded rewards and no annual fee, this is a great everyday-use card for anyone interested in earning cash back while growing credit. Check to prequalify ahead of time to avoid any harm on your credit score.</p>

<h3>Credit One Bank® Platinum X5 Visa®: Best credit-building + rewards</h3>

<p><strong>Best features:</strong> This Visa credit card carries a competitive cash back rewards program, particularly for people with fair credit. Cardholders receive 5% cash back on eligible gas, groceries, cell phone services, internet, and cable or satellite TV service purchases (on first $5,000 in spending per year, then 1%). They also get 1% cash back on general purchases.</p>

<p><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Your initial credit limit will be low: $500 minus the annual fee. The card carries a $95 annual fee, which can eat into rewards earnings. It also touts a high APR, no matter your credit history.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives:</strong> This card only gives the bonus cash back rate on $5,000 worth of eligible purchases per year. Shoppers who truly want to <a href="#">take advantage of a cash back card</a> with strong rates should check out the <a href="#">Chase Freedom Unlimited®</a> card, which lets you earn cash back on dining, travel through Chase Travel℠ and more without spending caps.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card is an option if you’re looking for rewards but can’t yet qualify for a top-tier rewards credit card. It’s also an option if you have fair credit and are looking for an <a href="#">unsecured (versus secured) credit card</a>.</p>

<h3>OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card: Best for low-interest + secured credit</h3>

<p><strong>Best features:</strong> For a secured card, this Visa credit card offers a particularly low interest rate. Also, you can get started with a refundable upfront security deposit of as little as $200 that serves as your credit limit. The card’s $35 annual fee is also reasonable for this category.</p>

<p><strong>Biggest drawback:</strong> There’s a $10 monthly inactive account fee, so you’ll need to use the credit card until you’re ready to close it.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Secured credit cards are designed to help people with no credit or bad credit build or rebuild their credit scores, so if you have good or even fair credit, you can likely qualify for a more flexible option such as the <a href="#">Credit One Bank® Platinum X5 Visa®</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you have bad credit and are concerned about carrying a balance from time to time, this low-interest secured credit card is an option.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="#">OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Upgrade Cash Rewards Visa®: Best for automatic installment plan</h3>

<p><strong>Best features:</strong> This unique Visa card combines elements of a credit card with elements of a personal loan. Cardholders make purchases which are automatically rolled into an installment plan with a fixed monthly payment. You’re expected to pay the full balance back within a 12- to 60-month period, with interest. Plus, the card actually has a rewards program where you can earn 1.5% cash back on card purchases every time you make a payment. It also doesn’t charge an annual fee or penalty fees.</p>

<p><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> While many cardholders will enjoy a low APR, some may not, given the high APR range. If you don’t have a hard time keeping balances under control, you’re likely better served by a traditional cash back credit card.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Someone who wants a traditional credit card to start their credit-building journey or rebuild their score should look to other <a href="#">cards for limited credit</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’ve struggled to manage your balances and make monthly payments in the past, this personal loan/credit card hybrid is an opportunity to rebuild your credit and show responsible payment behavior. It’s also a good option for someone looking to finance a large purchase and minimize the amount of interest they’ll pay.</p>

<h3>Marriott Bonvoy Bold® Credit Card: Best for hotels</h3>

<p><strong>Best features:</strong> Fans of the world’s largest hotel network will want to check in with this card, offering 3X points on purchases at Marriott Bonvoy properties, 2X points at grocery stores, rideshare, select food delivery, select streaming, and internet, cable, and phone services and 1X points on all other purchases. Cardholders can redeem points for a variety of hotel rewards and will also get complimentary Marriott Silver Elite status, all while avoiding an annual fee.</p>

<p><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This card’s rewards aren’t as valuable as some other <a href="#">travel card options</a>. Also, if you frequent other hotels outside of Marriott, a generic travel card such as the <a href="#">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> could be a more useful addition to your wallet. With the Venture card, there’s high redemption for travel and you earn miles on more than hotel stays.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Travelers who love to head to different cities but don’t have any loyalty to Marriott should look to more general travel rewards cards.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you tend to stay with Marriott, this could be a great choice for you. There’s no annual fee and a slew of hotel perks.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-visa-section">What is Visa?</h3>
<p>Launched in 1958, Visa is a card payment network, which processes the transactions between merchants and financial institutions.</p>
<p>The biggest of the four major credit card networks, Visa dominates the <a href="#">credit card market share</a>, followed by Mastercard, American Express and Discover. Unlike the Discover and American Express networks, Visa and Mastercard don’t issue their own cards. Instead, they partner with banks, such as <a href="#">Chase</a> and <a href="#">Capital One</a>, which use the card payment networks to process payments.</p>
<p>The lucrative perks that attract people to credit cards come from the banks. While the Visa logo carries a lot of power, it’s actually the banks that approve or decline your credit card application and provide features like the sign-up bonuses; 0% intro APR offers; and cash back, gas, and travel rewards. Card issuers also set your credit card limit and interest rates and report your credit history to the credit bureaus.</p>
<p>Luckily, Visa’s long-standing reputation has allowed it to partner with some of the top card issuers in the world. These partnerships have resulted in high-end sign-up bonuses, rewards offers, credit-building perks, travel benefits and more, creating some of the best cards on the market.</p>


<h3>Where is Visa accepted?</h3>
<p>Visa cards are accepted in more than 200 territories and countries worldwide at more than 44 million merchants. According to <a href="#">Visa rules and policy</a> there are countrywide prohibitions in countries such as Iran, Sudan and Syria due to U.S. sanctions and other laws. Otherwise, Visa cards are accepted at most places and can be used on almost any purchase, including when checking out at Costco – a luxury exclusive to Visa.</p>

<h3 id="credit-score-needed-section">What credit score is needed for a Visa credit card?</h3>
<p>Visa has options for everyone no matter their <a href="#">credit score</a>. Some of the top choices for Visa credit cards are secured cards and cards to rebuild your credit, allowing for lower-than-usual credit scores and creating the opportunity to grow your score with regular payments. Even those with limited or no credit have a path to take with Visa cards.</p>

<p>Visa also supports credit cards for higher credit ranges, giving cardholders strong rewards rates, travel perks, generous welcome offers and depending on your type of card, several further benefits. If your credit score isn’t there yet, <a href="#">improving your score</a> with one of Visa’s credit-building options is a great route to future savings.</p>

<h3 id="credit-card-benefits-section">What are Visa credit card benefits?</h3>
<p>Visa credit card benefits come with three levels: Traditional, Signature or Infinite. It'll cost a bit more to access the top level of Visa’s benefits tiers, but for the right cardholder, it could be well worth the price.</p>

<p>As each tier builds on the previous tier, it adds new benefits and programs to help you as you make purchases or take trips and can even get you out of a sticky situation. Just make sure to check with your card issuer (the bank that partners with Visa) because benefits may vary.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-choose-a-card-section">How to choose a Visa credit card</h3>
<p>To find the right Visa credit card for you, start by looking at your credit score, lifestyle, and the features important to you to get a broad idea of what you want out of a credit card. Our <a href="#">CardMatch™</a> feature can help narrow down the options based on your credit profile and make the decision easier. When comparing Visa cards, pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The level of Visa credit card benefits:</strong> Visa cards come in three tiers: Traditional, Signature or Infinite. While all three come with valuable benefits, they each are attached to a card with various levels of perks and fees. Seeing which benefits are most useful to you is an effective way to narrow down your card choice.</li>
  <li><strong>The card issuer’s benefits:</strong> While Visa has their selection of nice add-ons, you might find something that truly catches your eye when looking through the issuer’s benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>The annual fee:</strong> The card issuer may impose an annual fee, but it might be worth your while, depending on which Visa tier it has and what rewards the issuer offers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="visa-card-worth-it-section">Is a Visa credit card worth it?</h3>
<p>No matter what <a href="#">type of credit card</a> you’re after, Visa has an option for you. And like most credit cards, when <a href="#">used responsibly</a>, they provide a convenient form of payment that’s safer than carrying cash or using a debit card. Depending on the card, the built-in protections and features that come with Visa credit cards can add value to your wallet and your life. Factor in the potential sign-up bonuses, cash back rewards and other valuable perks offered by the financial institutions that partner with Visa, and you can see why so many people choose to carry Visa credit cards.</p>


<h3 id="our-methodology">How we picked the best Visa credit cards</h3>

<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> We analyzed Visa’s suite of cards to identify its top products in popular credit card categories. Core criteria we considered in our search include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Credit-building perks:</strong> With multiple cards designed for less-than-stellar credit, we found the top benefits to help cardholders grow their score.</li>
  <li><strong>Base rewards program:</strong> Does the card’s base rewards program offer a competitive return on spending for its card category (cash back, travel, business, etc.)?</li>
  <li><strong>Benefits tier:</strong> Does the card fall in the Traditional, Signature or Infinite tier? Wherever the card qualifies makes a substantial difference in additional benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>Annual fee:</strong> Does the card carry an annual fee? Some Visa cards do, so we assessed whether that fee could be offset by the card’s rewards program, welcome offer and any additional benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>Travel perks:</strong> With their global acceptance and cards geared for travelers, we made sure we found the Visa cards with the top travel opportunities.</li>
</ul>
