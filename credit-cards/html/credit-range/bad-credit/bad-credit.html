  <h2 style="font-size: 26px;" id="credit-cards-bad-credit-details-section" class="section-offset" >Editor’s picks: Credit cards for bad credit details</h2>
  <h3>Best for low fees: Chime Credit Builder Secured Visa® Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You can build credit without drowning in fees or interest and without tying up hundreds in a security deposit. You won’t even face a fee if you accidentally overdraft your account (up to $200 with SpotMe® overdraft fee protection).</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Since it doesn’t report on credit utilization — which makes up a big chunk of your credit score — it probably won’t be the most efficient credit-building tool. There’s also no way to graduate from this card to a full-fledged unsecured card with the same issuer (an option available on several traditional secured cards).</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you’re looking for a card that charges few fees but may be more effective for credit-building, consider the <a href="#">Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card</a>. It also charges no annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>) and has a low deposit requirement (just $49, which could potentially get you a credit limit of $200). However, this card reports credit utilization and could lead to an unsecured Capital One card down the line.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you want to build credit without paying traditional credit card fees or tying up money in a security deposit, this blend of a prepaid and secured card is a solid starting point.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best for flexible security deposits: Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> The Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card is one of the only secured cards that allows your initial credit limit to be higher than your security deposit (if you qualify). The required refundable security deposit ranges from $49 to $200, depending on your credit. Your initial credit limit ranges from $200 to $1,000, depending on your deposit.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The APR is on the high side, so you’ll want to avoid carrying a balance on this card.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> also has no annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>) and earns the same high APR as the Platinum Secured but earns an unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card is a great option thanks to the low security deposit requirements as well as no annual fee or foreign transaction fees (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best financial product for establishing credit: Self – Credit Builder Account with Secured Visa® Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> The Self – Credit Builder Account with Secured Visa Credit Card doesn’t require a credit history. You start out with a credit-builder account, but will automatically be eligible for the secured credit card once you’ve made three consecutive monthly payments on time, have at least $100 in savings and are in good standing.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You’ll pay an administrative fee for the account when you first sign up (terms will vary), and you’ll have to wait until your 24-month payments are complete to receive your deposit.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> You might save some money lost to fees if you get the <a href="#">Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card</a> and make sure to pay your balance in full each month.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This hybrid product could be a good option for people who can’t afford to put down a large upfront security deposit or people who want to be forced to save some money while they build their credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our full <a href="#">Self – Credit Builder Account with Secured Visa® Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for upgrading: Discover it® Secured Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> This card offers rewards, which isn’t common among credit cards available with bad credit. You also have a chance to graduate to an unsecured Discover card after seven months of responsible card use, making this card a great starting place to start if you’re looking for long-term value.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you wind up carrying a balance, the ongoing APR on purchases will eat away at the benefits of having a rewards credit card.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> earns an unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re in the market for a secured credit card (or your credit is only likely to qualify you for a secured credit card), this is a prime pick.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our full <a href="#">Discover it® Secured Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>


<h3>Best for no credit check: OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> If you need to carry a balance, the card’s 25.14% (variable) APR is relatively low. Plus, you don’t even need a bank account: You can pay your security deposit (up to $3,000) via check, Western Union or money order.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card does charge a $35 annual fee and an inactive account fee of $10 after 12 months of no activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Discover it® Secured Credit Card</a> charges no annual fee and earns 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants (up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter, then 1% cash back) and 1% cash back on all other purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The card is a good option for people with bad credit who anticipate carrying a balance from time to time, as its APR is one of the lower side for this card category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our full <a href="#">OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for no deposit: Prosper® Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> It offers plenty of credit-building features for an unsecured card, such as automatic reviews for credit limit increases, free financial courses and education, and a prequalification process. Plus, it has relatively few fees, making increasing your credit score easier on your wallet.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> It charges an annual fee after the first year ($39 annual fee waived the first year if you sign up for AutoPay before your first statement), so it may not be the best option if you want a no-annual-fee credit-building card.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card</a> has flexible deposits and no annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>), so it could be cheaper for credit-building than the Prosper Card (when used responsibly).</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> With relatively low fees, no security deposit requirement, and automatic reviews for credit line increases, the Prosper Card is a very accessible unsecured credit card option for people who want to improve their bad credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jump back to <a href="#">offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for soft credit pull + unsecured credit: Mission Lane Visa® Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> The Mission Lane Visa® Credit Card is a relatively low-cost unsecured credit card for people with bad credit, given it doesn’t charge monthly maintenance or activation fees. As an unsecured credit card, it also doesn’t require an upfront security deposit.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> That minimum credit limit is pretty low and the variable 26.99% – 29.99% APR range is high. So you’ll want to avoid carrying a balance on this card.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Discover it® Secured Credit Card</a> helps you build credit while also earning cash back on gas and restaurant purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you have bad credit, the Mission Lane Visa is an option. But once you reach fair credit, you could potentially qualify for a card with more favorable terms and conditions. See the <a href="#">best credit cards for fair credit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our full <a href="#">Mission Lane Visa® Credit Card review</a>.</p>


<h3>Best for flexible identification options: Zolve Azpire Credit Builder Card + Checking Account</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Zolve Azpire card functions as a debit and credit card in one. The card is light on fees, doesn’t charge interest on purchases, and reports some of your account activity to the credit bureaus.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card does not report credit utilization to the credit bureaus, which may slow your credit-building efforts.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Self — Credit Builder Account with Secured Visa Credit Card</a> is similar in function to the Zolve Azpire, but you’ll get a jump start on establishing a credit mix with the Self account.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Zolve Azpire Credit Builder Card + Checking Account is one of the first of its kind, and its fairly accessible approach to credit building definitely makes it worth a look.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-bad-credit-section">What is bad credit?</h3>
<p>A “bad credit” score is typically under 580 out of a range of 300 to 850 as defined by FICO, with 850 being the best possible score. Using the same 300 to 850 scale, a VantageScore defines “poor credit” as a credit score under 600. In the eyes of financial institutions, a bad credit score represents a risky or unproven consumer. Typically, bad credit originates from one of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Credit card or loan defaults:</strong> Failing to pay off credit card bills or pay back a loan – also known as defaulting – marks you as a clear credit risk to lenders.</li>
    <li><strong>Late payments:</strong> Your payment history accounts for 35% of your credit score. If you’re late with your payments – on credit cards, student loans or mortgages – your credit will take a big hit.</li>
    <li><strong>Maxing out your cards:</strong> <a href="#">Credit utilization</a> – the amount you’ve borrowed compared to your total available credit – accounts for another 30% of your score. The lower your credit utilization, the better. Check out our <a href="#">credit utilization calculator</a> to calculate yours today.</li>
    <li><strong>Charge offs:</strong> When a creditor decides you have no intention of paying back your debt and stops collection attempts, your account becomes charged off.</li>
    <li><strong>Bankruptcy:</strong> While it’s sometimes your only option to get out of debt, bankruptcy is a credit score disaster, and should only be used as a last resort.</li>
    <li><strong>Foreclosure:</strong> The higher your starting credit score, the bigger a drop you’ll see as a result of foreclosure.</li>
    <li><strong>Judgments:</strong> Judgments show lenders that the court system had to force you to pay off your debt. Be sure to settle your debts, as an unpaid judgment is worse than a paid judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bad credit can lead to several obstacles. You could face higher interest rates, trouble with financing approval, difficulty renting an apartment, higher insurance premiums and even issues when applying for certain jobs. Luckily, <a href="#">understanding bad credit scores</a> is often the first step to improvement.</p>

<h3>Why improving your bad credit is important</h3>
<p>Just as bad credit hinders what you can do, good credit can open doors to new possibilities. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Interest savings:</strong> When taking out a loan to finance a home or car, the slightest difference in interest rate can cost thousands over the lifetime of the loan. The better your credit score, the more likely you are to be approved for the best rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Better terms:</strong> A good credit score can also earn you more generous payment schedules and credit limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Access to top credit cards:</strong> Cards with lucrative rewards, friendlier interest rates and can’t-miss sign-up bonuses are available to people with good credit. (Check out the <a href="#">best credit cards for good credit</a>.)</li>
    <li><strong>Save on insurance:</strong> A good score may qualify you for lower premiums on car insurance.</li>
    <li><strong>Better financial reputation:</strong> Some landlords, rental management companies, utility companies and potential employers look at your credit score. Your score is meant to show how financially trustworthy you are, so being in good standing will protect you from any hassle.</li>
</ul>

    <h3 style="color: #004C3F; border-bottom: 2px solid #004C3F;">Pros of a credit card for bad credit</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Raise your credit score:</strong> Using a credit card responsibly is one of the fastest ways to grow your credit score and improve your credit history. As you continue to raise your score, you’re seen as less of a credit risk. This will help give you access to credit cards and loans that come with better perks and lower rates and fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Easier approval process:</strong> If you’re just starting out or rebuilding your credit after financial setbacks, many credit cards can be out of reach. Credit cards for bad credit are designed with a low barrier of entry to help consumers build their credit from the ground up.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit-building tools:</strong> Credit cards in this category frequently offer a host of financial education resources, free access to your credit score and auto-pay. Some issuers will even review your account for a credit line increase after several months of good financial behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #9B2E2E; border-bottom: 2px solid #9B2E2E;">Cons of a credit card for bad credit</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Higher interest rates:</strong> Credit scores are designed to gauge the likelihood of a consumer defaulting on a credit card, so creditors will often charge a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk they assume when taking on a cardholder with bad credit.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of rewards:</strong> Credit cards designed for bad credit typically lack rewards like cash back, travel points and miles, as well as introductory offers or sign-up bonuses. However, these enticing features can become a possibility as you work towards building your credit.</li>
      <li><strong>Security deposits:</strong> Many credit cards in this category are secured, meaning you’ll need to make an initial deposit (usually between $200 and $5,000) to serve as your credit limit as you open your account.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Who Should Get Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should get a credit card for bad credit</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The credit beginner:</strong> A credit card for bad credit offers access to a credit line so you can start building credit with on-time payments and other responsible use.</li>
      <li><strong>The credit rebuilder:</strong> People who have experienced financial setbacks may find it difficult to qualify for a more typical, unsecured credit card or a card that offers better perks and rewards. Because credit cards in this category typically have a straightforward approval process, you can shift your focus to using your card responsibly (via on-time payments and low credit utilization) and eventually you should be able to graduate to a better credit card.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Who Should Skip Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should skip a credit card for bad credit</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The rewards seeker:</strong> Credit cards for people with bad credit are designed with credit-building as the main objective. So you’ll likely miss out on the more lucrative programs attached to traditional or premium rewards credit cards until your issuer permits an upgrade.</li>
      <li><strong>The frequent revolver:</strong> If you consistently carry a balance over from month to month, the higher interest rates commonly associated with this type of card can make it harder to pay off your debt.</li>
    </ul>

<p>A credit card for bad credit can be a lifeline for rebuilding your credit. However, you need to do your research. Some credit cards for bad credit compensate for riskier lending with high APRs and harsh penalties. You should weigh the benefits against potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>Here are the key elements to keep in mind when evaluating credit cards for bad credit:</p>

    <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Credit cards for people with bad credit tend to carry a lot of fees. Make sure to look at the card’s rates and fees on the application page. Primary fees, such as late fee and foreign transaction fee are shown at the top of the document (called the Schumer Box), but keep an eye out for lesser-known fees appearing further down in the text.</li>
    <li><strong>APR:</strong> Cards for bad credit often bring along high interest rates and in an unfortunate situation – penalty APRs. As such, getting the lowest rate possible should be one of your top priorities if you know you’ll carry a balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum/maximum security deposit:</strong> If your card requires a deposit, check the range offered to see if it works for you. Can you afford to tie up $1,000?</li>
    <li><strong>Credit limit:</strong> You’ll want to be sure the card offers a limit that’s high enough to allow you to keep your credit utilization low.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Secured vs. unsecured credit cards for bad credit</h3>
<p>There are two main types of cards to consider when you’re looking for a credit card with bad credit: secured and unsecured cards. Both can be a useful tool in your credit-rebuilding efforts.</p>

<h4>Secured credit cards</h4>
<p><a href="#">Secured cards</a> require a refundable deposit, which is usually equal to your credit limit. With many cards, after 6 to 12 months of on-time payments, you should be able to get your deposit back and graduate to a traditional (unsecured) credit card with a higher limit.</p>

<h3 id="make-the-most-of-card-section">How to make the most of a credit card for fair credit</h3>
<p>When applying for a fair or average credit card, it is important to keep the goal of improving your credit in mind. Here are some tips on how someone with fair credit can get the most value out of their credit card:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use your card to build credit.</strong> The most important aspect of using a card that requires fair or average credit is that you can build your credit with it, which will grant you access to better lending products.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your utilization ratio low.</strong> People with fair credit tend to have cards with low credit limits. To keep your balances low and avoid increasing your credit utilization ratio, make small, multiple payments throughout the month.</li>
    <li><strong>Look for a card without an annual fee.</strong> By taking out a card with no annual fee, you minimize the costs incurred with card membership.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice with rewards.</strong> Cards for fair or average cards will sometimes have rewards, such as 1% back on all purchases. This is a good way to practice for getting a rewards card down the road. Make sure you don’t carry a balance because interest charges will negate your rewards.</li>
    <li><strong>Look to increase your credit limit.</strong> After you’ve established a several-month trend of paying on time and in full, you could contact your carrier and negotiate a longer credit limit. Some providers will review your account for an increase automatically, so pay attention to your card’s fine print.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t close your old card.</strong> Once your credit score has risen to the point that you can apply for a better card, don’t close or stop using your card for fair credit. By continuing to use it, at least for small charges, you keep the account active, continuing to build credit with it, and you increase your available credit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Check for and report errors on your credit reports</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, credit reports do include the occasional error, but the bright side is there are <a href="#">ways to dispute credit report errors</a> that pop up. Routinely checking your report is a good way to prevent long-term impact from a mistake.</p>
<p>Breaches are a top cause for the need to check those credit reports. With several instances in just the past few years, <a href="#">protecting yourself against data breaches</a> is as important as ever.</p>
<p>What should you do? Besides varying your passwords, regularly check your credit files for mistakes. Notify the credit bureaus of any errors you find, no matter how small, because even a little one can be a sign that you’re a victim of fraud, and that can ultimately impact your score.</p>


<h3>Are there credit cards for fair/average credit with instant approval?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are cards that offer <a href="#">instant approval</a>, even if you have fair/average credit. Instant approval cards can be a great way to learn within minutes if you are conditionally accepted as a cardmember. Just keep in mind that instant approval isn’t a guarantee that you will be granted the card – a more thorough check of your file will be conducted if you are allowed conditional approval. Plus, whether you can get approved or denied right away is based on if the company can verify your identity. In the case that your identity cannot be easily identified, the application process could take a few days. Focusing on cards that fit within your credit range is crucial to your financial health, and using the card responsibly is the key to strengthening your credit. Check out our list of the top <a href="#">instant approval cards</a> to see if any are a good option for you.</p>


<h3>What do I do if I’m rejected for a credit card?</h3>
<p>If your hopes of landing a credit card of your dreams have been dashed, we can help. By taking the right steps, you can recover and get the card you want and need.</p>

<h3>1. Have your application reconsidered</h3>
<p>It’s no surefire solution, but you should contact the card issuer to see if they’d review your application again. If you’re able to argue your case, you might be able to get your foot in the door. Some card providers might be more willing to accept you as a cardholder after you’ve shown extra initiative.</p>

<h3>2. Get the explanation from the issuer</h3>
<p>Issuers are required to explain to you why you were rejected. You might find out online, by phone or by mail – no matter which way, read the issuer’s feedback, then try to fix the situation.</p>


<h3>3. Check your credit score and credit reports</h3>
<p>In general, it’s a good idea to check your credit reports several times a year. You can <a href="#">check them for free once a year at AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. If you’ve been rejected by a card issuer, make a point of checking your credit files to make sure there are no errors or omissions.</p>

<h3>4. Look at a credit-builder loan with your credit union</h3>
<p>If your credit files are too weak for even a basic secured card, talk to your local credit union about getting a <a href="#">credit-builder loan</a>. These loans are designed for improving your credit rather than getting money for a home improvement or car.</p>

<h3>5. Catch up on your bills</h3>
<p>Payment history has the biggest impact on your credit score. If you are behind on any bills, you should call the creditor and arrange to pay the past due amounts. After making your payments, you can request that the creditor rescind any reported delinquencies so they will no longer show up on your credit report. While this may be the slowest step, it is essential to improving your credit score. Finally, your more recent activity weighs more heavily, so those <a href="#">on-time payments are priceless.</a></p>

<h3>6. Don’t close accounts</h3>
<p>If you already have cards, don’t close them. Instead, pay them down and keep using them. Why? Because your payment history remains on your credit files for several years, good or bad, so you aren’t protecting your credit just by closing the account. In fact, the available credit on your cards helps your file, as does continuing to pay on time.</p>

<h3>7 . Wait several months</h3>
<p>Wait several months before applying for a card again. Too many card applications too close together can mean desperation to a lender. Also, this gives your score a chance to improve.</p>

<h3>8. Apply for a card you are reasonably sure you will get</h3>
<p>In this case, don’t reach for the stars. Instead, choose a card to apply for that you are pretty sure you can get. If you are unable to qualify for an unsecured card, try a <a href="#">secured card</a> to help build your credit.</p>


<h4>Unsecured credit cards</h4>
<p>An unsecured credit card won’t require you to put down a security deposit to borrow money. You’re given a credit limit based on your creditworthiness and can borrow up to that amount. A high credit limit will also likely improve your credit score by helping your credit utilization.</p>

<h3 id="getting-credit-card-bad-credit-section">How to get a credit card with bad credit</h3>
<p>If you’ve made a few financial mistakes or don’t have a credit history, you may be wondering if it’s even possible for you to get accepted for a credit card. It is, but here are a few steps you can take to increase your odds of approval.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Check your credit report.</strong> Even if your credit is poor, knowing how close you are to having fair credit allows you to decide whether you should apply now or wait until you’ve given your credit a boost and have better options. The <a href="#">3 major credit bureaus</a> are required to report at least once per year. You can request yours <a href="#">online</a>, by phone or by mail.</li>
    <li><strong>Dispute any fraudulent or incorrect activity.</strong> If your credit score is surprisingly low, you may want to do some investigating. Mistakes are common on credit reports, and it’s possible that a mishap or fraud is wrongfully affecting your credit. If you find mistakes, be sure to <a href="#">dispute the incorrect items on your credit report</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Pay down any debt if you’re able.</strong> One of the major factors that go into your credit score is your <a href="#">credit utilization ratio</a>. A high utilization ratio can lower your credit score, so it’s a good idea to pay down existing balances before you apply for a new credit card.</li>
    <li><strong>Look for a card that matches your situation.</strong> Once you’ve done your research, it’s time to start browsing credit cards. Be sure to pick a card with credit requirements you can satisfy. That is, don’t waste time looking at or applying for cards that require good credit if yours isn’t quite there yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>The cards at the top of this page do have low credit requirements, though it’s important to note that if you are currently in bankruptcy or foreclosure, have a recent history of bankruptcy, or are currently delinquent or in default on other accounts, your application will most likely be denied. In these cases, <a href="#">secured credit cards</a> are a better option. They require a one-time, refundable security deposit and some even offer rewards.</p>



<h3>What to do if your application is denied</h3>
<p>Luckily, you won’t be left in the dark on the “why,” as issuers are legally required to send you an <a href="#">adverse action notice</a> explaining why you were denied.</p>

<p>Here are some common reasons for denial and what you can do about them:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Too much debt</strong> – Your balances are too high. With substantial outstanding debt, card providers may be hesitant to take you on as a cardholder. Make a budget and pay more than the minimum each month to pay down your existing debt. It’s sometimes easier said than done, but making regular payments is a surefire way to help your credit score through improving your utilization and payment history.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited credit history</strong> – Wait a couple of months, then apply for a secured card designed for credit building. Within months, your score will improve with on-time payments. After showing that you’re a reliable cardholder, you’ll likely graduate to an unsecured option or will have obtained the credit necessary for another card of your choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Low income</strong> – Plenty of cards for bad credit will allow for low income, so you should have other viable options. When providing proof of income to a card provider as part of the application process, keep in mind that non-traditional income like income from a partner or retirement fund distributions <a href="#">counts as income on a credit card application</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Too many applications</strong> – Take a break from applying for cards for several months and focus on building your credit with a credit-builder loan. Applying for cards multiple times within a small window can actually hurt your credit score. Look for cards that offer prequalification the next time you plan on applying.</li>
    <li><strong>Too young</strong> – People under 21 must have an independent source of income to get a card, which can make the application process difficult. Through a parent or guardian, people younger than 21 can become authorized users on credit cards and have the chance to boost their credit beforehand. Also, <a href="#">top student cards</a> are often great options for young adults.</li>
    <li><strong>Negative information on credit reports</strong> – Late payments or judgments, such as bankruptcies, take time to drop off your reports. If you’re committed to getting a credit card, however, exploring your options might lead you to a choice that allows for bankruptcy or a less-than-ideal payment history. Just pay on time and in full going forward. You should also look at your credit report to see if there are any errors or fraudulent information.</li>
    <li><strong>Score too low</strong> – If the issue is your credit score, you can look at a credit-builder loan at your credit union. About <a href="#">1 in 5 credit unions offer credit-builder loans</a>. When approved for a loan, the same principles of being a good cardholder apply. Routinely making timely, sufficient payments will go a long way.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were denied a credit card but feel that you met the requirements, you can always contact the provider and ask to speak with their reconsideration department for another chance. Taking this step is no guarantee that you’ll be approved, but just asking to be re-evaluated could get you somewhere. Providers typically see taking initiative as a good sign, and plenty have been known to approve applicants who were previously denied.</p>

    <h3>In the news: How to live on credit cards during an emergency</h3>
    <p>Emergencies happen. And when they do, it’s always a good idea to have money set aside. An emergency fund is your best option because it protects you from having to rely on loans when surprises happen.</p>
    <p>Without an emergency fund, you risk falling into or falling further into debt since borrowing money typically comes with interest charges and other fees. To make matters worse, when you have bad credit, you will have a harder time qualifying for loans to help you out of an emergency. And without adequate access to funds, you may feel like you have no choice but to settle for predatory lending options like payday loans. But these loans may come with interest rates that can soar over 600%.</p>
    <p>A credit card can’t take the place of an emergency fund. But if you don’t have that savings, it can be a lifeline to help out when an emergency happens. <a href="#">Erica Sandberg</a> has a step-by-step guide that explains <a href="#">how to use credit cards during an emergency.</a></p>

<h3 id="our-methodology-section">Research methodology: How we got to our top picks</h3>
<p>We evaluated 269 credit cards for bad credit to identify the top products in this category. Core criteria we considered in our analysis include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Costs and fees:</strong> Credit cards for bad credit often carry upfront costs, including annual fees and security deposits. They also sometimes carry hidden fees for items like replacement cards. We gave more weight to cards with lower and/or limited fees.</li>
    <li><strong>APRs:</strong> Credit cards for bad credit often carry higher interest rates, given applicants generally represent more of a credit risk. However, we still evaluated whether a card’s APRs were competitive for this category and how they stacked up relevant to the <a href="#">current industry average</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Although a poor credit score won’t let you get top-notch rewards, several options here allow you to earn on your spending. (Note: Consider avoiding cards with rewards if you fear they will entice you to overspend.)</li>
    <li><strong>Added benefits:</strong> Many cards offer the ability to increase your credit limit, tools to track your credit score, added security, regular reporting to the major credit bureaus, and more. Some of these benefits can really help you build your credit score.</li>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>It will be very difficult to get a credit card without a bank account. Even most cards backed by a deposit require you to have a bank account.

    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>You certainly can, though not all issuers offer prequalification. Luckily, those that do typically determine who prequalifies for a card with a soft credit pull, which won’t impact your credit score. That said, your application can still be denied even after you’ve prequalified. Credit cards for bad credit that offer prequalification include: Credit One Bank Visa for Rebuilding Credit, Indigo Platinum Mastercard, and Milestone Gold Mastercard.</p>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Yes. Not only is it possible to find a credit card after bankruptcy, it’s a great way to get your credit back on track. To save time and protect your credit score, it’s best to only apply for credit cards explicitly stating that previous bankruptcy is OK, such as the Indigo Platinum Mastercard and the Milestone Gold Mastercard.</p>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>It’s technically possible to do a balance transfer with bad credit, but it’s probably not practical. The only cards you’re likely to qualify for that allow balance transfers are secured cards, and it usually makes more sense to tackle paying down your balance and building your credit for a bit until you’re eligible for better balance transfer cards.</p>

      <p>While there’s no official credit “blacklist,” if you’ve burned a credit card company in the past, they may be unlikely to offer you any new credit for years to come.

      <p>A store credit card could be a solid bad credit option, offering a low entry barrier and a chance to build credit while you earn rewards at your favorite retailer. But there are some drawbacks to store credit cards, namely they tend to carry high APRs, deferred interest and potentially limited acceptance. The rewards could also entice you to overspend. To ensure good habits, pick a card tied to a store you visit frequently for everyday purchases.</p>
