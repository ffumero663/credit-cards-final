          When you are just starting out, it can be tough to land the car you want, the apartment you need and even the job you are hoping for. These milestones are made even more difficult because consumers must have good credit if they want to be taken seriously by lenders or credit issuers.
          <br>
          <br>
          Fortunately, there are credit cards specifically designed for people who are new to credit. Nearly anyone can be approved, and <a href="#">you can establish credit</a> relatively quickly when you prove that you can use these cards responsibly. Making on-time payments should come first and foremost, but you can <a href="#">use additional strategies</a> in your mission to build credit.

  <h2 style="font-size: 26px;" id="prepaid-card-details-section" class="section-offset" >Editor‚Äôs picks: A closer look at our top-rated credit cards for people with no credit</h2>
  


  <h3>Best student credit card for people with no credit: Discover it¬Æ Student Cash Back</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Even if you‚Äôre just learning the ropes of credit, you don‚Äôt have to wait to start earning rewards. Cardholders can earn 5% cash back on rotating quarterly bonus categories, up to $1,500 per quarter, then 1% (activation required). Plus, Discover will match all of the cash back you‚Äôve earned at the end of your first year. With no annual fee and plenty of perks, this is an excellent choice for a starter credit card.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Some new cardholders might be overwhelmed by bonus categories that change each quarter. If that‚Äôs the case, a flat-rate card is likely a better choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> <a href="#">The Journey Student Rewards card from Capital One</a> charges no foreign transaction fees, making it ideal for study abroad students. Plus, cardholders can increase their cash back rate from 1% to 1.25% after establishing a history of on-time payments.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card‚Äôs ongoing variable APR is competitive for a card that caters to students and people with limited credit history.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best for flexible deposit: Chime Credit Builder Secured Visa¬Æ Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Many credit-building cards come burdened with high fees and APRs or require a $200 minimum deposit before you can start building credit, but the Chime card keeps fees to a minimum, charging no annual fees or interest. It also features no minimum security deposit requirement for Chime checking account holders with eligible direct deposit, making it more flexible than the average secured card.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Unlike several competing cards (including those with no annual fee), the Chime card doesn‚Äôt come with a rewards program, so it may not be the best value overall. And since the card doesn‚Äôt report on credit utilization ‚Äî a key factor in credit scoring ‚Äî it may take you a bit longer to build credit.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card</a> charges no annual fee (See rates and fees) and gives you a chance at a $200 credit limit with only a $49 deposit (based on your credit history). You may also be able to upgrade to an unsecured Capital One card with responsible use, making it a potentially better fit long term.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you like the idea of a low-cost secured card, but don‚Äôt want to tie up hundreds in a deposit, this card may strike the perfect balance for you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best for increasing your credit limit: Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card‚Äôs minimum security deposit gives cardholders the flexibility to start low if they need to. Consideration for a credit limit increase after six months gives you a chance to quickly access even more credit.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> There‚Äôs no sign-up bonus, no ongoing rewards and the regular APR is a super high, making it a poor option for carrying a balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Citi¬Æ Secured Mastercard¬Æ</a> is a great alternative to the Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card if you want a card with a lower APR and the ability to graduate to an unsecured card down the line.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> With the Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card, you have the opportunity to raise your credit limit after your first six months of on-time payments and responsible use, which is a solid feature for a credit-building card.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this card‚Äôs <a href="#">offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for building credit + rewards: Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The flat cash back rate of 1.5% on all purchases is a nice feature for a secured credit-building card.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You‚Äôll need to pay your balances in full each month to avoid the high APR and there is a minimum of a $200 deposit to open an account.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Petal¬Æ 2 ‚ÄúCash Back, No Fees‚Äù Visa¬Æ Credit Card</a> is an unsecured credit card that won‚Äôt require a $200 security deposit and can earn up to 1.5% back on all purchases after a year of responsible card use.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> With responsible use, the Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card can add value to your wallet while helping you improve your credit score. If you want a higher credit limit though, you‚Äôll either need to deposit more or look elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this card‚Äôs <a href="#">offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best low APR card for people with no credit: Self ‚Äì Credit Builder Account with Secured Visa¬Æ Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You can avoid having to put down the upfront security deposit required of most traditional secured credit cards, as you‚Äôll be making three monthly installment payments instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You‚Äôll pay a one-time account fee of $9, which varies by the product and a $25 annual fee for the credit card. Plus, you‚Äôll have to wait at least three months to have access to your secured credit card depending on payment habits.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Though it‚Äôs a secured card, the <a href="#">Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card</a> offers an exceptionally low entry barrier. You could put down as little as $49 as a refundable deposit and still get a $200 credit limit, making this a great choice for people with few funds to commit to a deposit, but who still need a decent credit limit.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This hybrid financial product, which starts off as a credit-builder loan, could transition into a secured credit card (with at least three monthly payments on time, $100 or more in savings in your credit-builder account, and an account in good standing), carries a 26.99% variable APR.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best no-annual-fee card for people with no credit: Capital One Platinum Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> With the Capital One Platinum, you can pay by check, online or at a local branch without paying a fee. Also, you can pick your monthly due date.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Unfortunately, this card has no sign-up bonus or ongoing rewards, making it a tough choice if you are looking for a multi-purpose card for the long haul.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Petal¬Æ 1 ‚ÄúNo Annual Fee‚Äù Visa¬Æ Credit Card</a> is a terrific option for credit-builders since it‚Äôs available even with no credit history, charges no annual fee, does not require a security deposit and offers a chance at a credit limit as high as $5,000, depending on your credit history and financial profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This is an affordable, no frills option for people who want a simple way to build credit without having to worry about hidden fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One Platinum Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this card‚Äôs <a href="#">offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for No credit check: Zolve Azpire Credit Builder Card + Checking Account</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> No credit check is required to apply for this card, and it doesn‚Äôt charge an annual fee, foreign transaction fee or interest charges. Finally, you could earn up to 10% cash back at select merchants.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The Zolve Azpire also does not report credit utilization or a credit limit, so the journey to building your score could be slow.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you still want to skip the credit check with your application, the <a href="#">OpenSky¬Æ Secured Visa¬Æ Credit Card</a> offers this perk as well. Just remember that you have to pay an annual fee for the OpenSky Secured and you‚Äôll have to put up a refundable security deposit of at least $200.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Zolve Azpire is not your typical credit-builder card, but it still gets the job done. If you want a card that‚Äôs one of the most accessible on the market, give this one a look.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our full <a href="#">Zolve Azpire Credit Builder Card + Checking Account review</a>.</p>

<h3>Best credit-building card for people with no credit: Citi¬Æ Secured Mastercard¬Æ</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> There‚Äôs no annual fee and you can choose your credit limit based on what you can afford as a security deposit. You can put down as little as $200 to start and earn your deposit back by demonstrating good credit habits.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This card offers no rewards. If that‚Äôs important to you, there are <a href="#">secured cards</a> that do offer rewards programs.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Big wins for the <a href="#">Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card</a> are its friendly user terms and low entry barrier. With a minimum $49 deposit (depending on your credit) you can have this card in your wallet with a $200-$1,000 initial credit limit (depending on your deposit).</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> A good choice for credit building, this card‚Äôs security deposit is refundable if you upgrade to an unsecured card within the first 18 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Citi¬Æ Secured Mastercard¬Æ review</a>.</p>


<h3>Best gas rewards card for people with no credit: Discover it¬Æ Student Chrome</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The ongoing rewards on this card are excellent, with 2% back at gas stations and restaurants up to $1,000 a quarter on combined spending (then 1% thereafter), as well as Discover matching all the cash back you earn at the end of your first year.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The regular variable APR is high, which can make it a poor choice for carrying a balance, although you can get a limited intro APR on purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> While the <a href="#">Chase Freedom¬Æ Student credit card</a> comes with an underwhelming rewards rate of 1% back on all purchases, those who plan on staying with Chase for the long haul might later enjoy its lucrative Chase Ultimate Rewards program.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Discover it¬Æ Student Chrome has no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees as well as no categories to activate each quarter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Discover it¬Æ Student Chrome review</a>.</p>

<h3>Best flat-rate rewards card for people with no credit: Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Because this card comes with an unlimited flat-rate cash back program, there is no required quarterly signup or maximum allowed spend. Also, your cash back doesn‚Äôt expire for the life of the card.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This card doesn‚Äôt have a sign-up bonus, unlike the Capital One Quicksilver card. Also, there‚Äôs an annual fee of $39 (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>), which isn‚Äôt waived the first year, and the regular variable APR is incredibly high.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you are just learning the ropes of credit building, the <a href="#">Discover it¬Æ Secured Credit Card</a> is a great choice. Plus, the issuer will match all of the cash back you earned at the end of your first year.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The QuicksilverOne immediately delivers you 1.5% cash back for every purchase, every day, making it competitive with other <a href="#">cash back cards</a>, such as the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards Credit Card review</a>.</p>

<h3>Best sign-up bonus for people with no credit: Chase Freedom¬Æ Student credit card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The card features a good base rewards program: Cardholders receive 1% cash back on all purchases and an additional 4% cash back on Lyft rides (through March 2025). They also receive a $20 bonus (or 2,000 points) each account anniversary that their account is still open and in good standing (meaning they‚Äôre making minimum payments on time) for up to the first five years of card ownership.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This card is designed for student credit cardholders, so if you‚Äôre outside that demographic, you might want to consider other credit cards for no credit. (Learn more about the <a href="#">best student credit cards</a>.)</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Like the Freedom Student, the <a href="#">Capital One Journey Student Rewards card</a> offers 1% cash back on every purchase. With the Journey, however, cardholders can boost their cash back for any month to 1.25% when they pay their bill on time.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This student credit card from Chase offers new cardholders a $50 bonus after they make their first purchase within the first 3 months from account opening and earns solid, ongoing rewards every year with generous account anniversary bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Chase Freedom¬Æ Student credit card review</a>.</p>


<h3>Best credit card for people with no credit: Discover it¬Æ Secured Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The credit limit ranges from $200 to $2,500 depending on what you‚Äôre comfortable putting down.

Plus, you can quickly check to see if you‚Äôre preapproved with no impact on your credit score. If approved, you won‚Äôt have to worry about having to pay an annual fee, foreign transaction fees, late payment fees or a penalty APR.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This card may only be good for credit building, especially if your lack of credit qualifies you for the card‚Äôs lowest credit limit. If you have an emergency expense, the card‚Äôs minimum $300 credit limit may not be enough to cover your needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Discover it¬Æ Student Cash Back</a> is a good choice if you‚Äôre seeking cash back rewards, plus it offers a limited intro APR on purchases.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-prepaid-card-section">How can I get a credit card if I have no credit history?</h3>
<p>There are cards designed for people who are new to credit. Sometimes, their issuers want you to have a checking account, and they may require a refundable deposit of at least $200. Here is what you need to know about getting a card when you don‚Äôt have credit history.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Check your credit.</strong> You‚Äôll want to know exactly where you stand and track your progress as you start to build credit. You can pull your credit reports for free at least once a year via AnnualCreditReport.com and you can get a credit score for free or for a nominal fee through various websites. Learn <a href="#">how to get your credit score</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Look into a credit-builder loan.</strong> Check with your local financial institution about these small loans, which are designed primarily to help you build your credit. A local credit union is an excellent choice. You will likely need to open a checking or savings account with the institution.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider a secured card.</strong> The fastest and easiest way to build credit is with a credit card, and a relatively easy card to land is a secured card. That‚Äôs because you put down a refundable deposit that is used to secure your credit limit. Just make sure the card issuer is going to send your credit habits to the credit bureaus. If they aren‚Äôt, then you won‚Äôt be building credit.</li>
    <li><strong>Research, then apply for one card.</strong> With your score handy, look at cards you are likely to get, checking annual fees and any other charges that might be incurred. If you‚Äôd like to earn rewards you can also weigh cash back or points-earning rates into your decision. However, you should prioritize establishing and building credit without the temptation of earning more back with more spending.</li>
    <li><strong>See about being an authorized user.</strong> If you don‚Äôt think you will be able to get your own card or you want to take baby steps, see if you can become an authorized user on a responsible consumer‚Äôs card. Just make sure they pay on time and in full each month because their good credit habits will go on your file. Not all card issuers report authorized users‚Äô information to the credit bureaus, so check with close friends and relatives which card they‚Äôre using before committing to this route. If everything checks out, in a few months, you will be able to apply for your own card.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to build your credit with no or little credit</h3>
<p>Building credit can take some time, but there are steps you can take to jumpstart the process. Here are just a few of them.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Pay your bills on time.</strong> You want to establish a responsible payment history, the biggest factor among the major credit scoring models. Even delinquent utility bills or rent payments can hurt your credit if the accounts wind up in collections.</li>
    <li><strong>Get a credit card that you can use responsibly.</strong> This is the fastest way to build credit, given there are credit cards designed for applicants with no credit history and the barrier for approval can be low.</li>
    <li><strong>Use your credit card.</strong> By making a small charge on your card each month, you keep your account active. Try not to overspend, though. If you keep your <a href="#">credit utilization</a> low, then your score will continue to rise. Note: You don‚Äôt have to carry a balance to build credit; you can simply pay this charge off in full each month.</li>
    <li><strong>Pay your card in full.</strong> If you pay your card in full each month, you avoid paying interest charges and you build your credit much faster. That‚Äôs because your available credit and your balance are factored into your score as a formula known as credit utilization. If your available credit is $1,000 and your balance is $100, then your credit utilization ratio is 10%. The lower your credit utilization rate, the better.</li>
    <li><strong>Don‚Äôt be tempted to take out more credit.</strong> Think strategically ‚Äì don‚Äôt apply for loans or credit cards without a plan because applications can affect your credit. However, there are some times when taking out credit is a good idea. For example, by taking out a credit-builder loan or some other type of installment loan, such as a car loan, you give your credit a little boost.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="pros-and-cons-section">Pros and cons of credit cards for people with no credit history</h3>

<h4>Pros of credit cards for people with no credit history</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Grow your score.</strong> Most cards designed for those with limited or no credit history come with perks built to help increase your credit score. Be sure that your card reports payment habits to the <a href="#">three major credit bureaus</a>, a must-have benefit found with the majority of cards featured in this list.</li>
    <li><strong>Control when you spend.</strong> With several of the cards here, you can work with your provider to negotiate a payment schedule that works for you. Setting your calendar to work smoothly around when you get paid and when your bills are due can be a flexible solution for some hectic schedules.</li>
    <li><strong>Establish good habits.</strong> Because these cards are a fresh slate for so many cardholders, you have the opportunity to start on a high note. If you‚Äôre an exemplary cardholder and commit to a routine of good habits while keeping the demerits away, your score could grow expeditiously.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons of credit cards for people with no credit history</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of extras.</strong> Cards for people with no credit don‚Äôt come with all the fancy frills featured with top cards. Although you can find solid cash back rewards cards here, you might have to wait until you reach <a href="#">good credit</a> to take advantage of worthwhile sign-up bonuses, welcome offers and other juicy incentives.</li>
    <li><strong>Issuers penalize mistakes.</strong> This isn‚Äôt exclusive to cards for no credit, but by accepting applicants with low credit scores, card providers are taking on more risk with lesser-proven cardholders. When calculating that risk, they often charge extraordinarily high APRs if you carry a balance. Along with this, they may also tack on hidden fees when you slip up.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited spending.</strong> Many starter cards will give low credit limits when beginning your journey, leaving some cardholders with little flexibility in their monthly spending. If you‚Äôre expecting to use your card for larger purchases or to run up an expensive bill, explore your options to see where you can get the most buying power.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-choose-prepaid-card-section">How to choose a credit card with no credit history</h3>

<h4>Who should get a card for no credit history</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The new cardholder.</strong> A little self-explanatory, but if you‚Äôre new to the credit card world, a card for people with no credit history can be a great place to get started. With minimal risk for approval hurdles, you can begin setting the trend of good habits to grow your score and can get acclimated to what it‚Äôs like to carry a credit card.</li>
    <li><strong>The student saver.</strong> College students and other young adults have lots to take advantage of with cards for no credit history. Some cards here come with cash back rates on student-focused purchases and other useful perks to help young credit-builders get started.</li>
    <li><strong>The rebuilding cardholder.</strong> If you‚Äôve suffered from debt, bankruptcy or anything else that may crush your credit score, one of the choices here may be your saving grace. Although the cards here are designed for no credit history, some will allow for experienced cardholders with poor scores who are trying to climb back.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Who should skip a card for no credit history</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The debt conqueror.</strong> If you‚Äôre looking to tackle a debt problem, a credit card could be a great place to start. However, many options here are built to help those with no credit or who need to recover from bad credit. Debt is a separate issue. You might be better off with a <a href="#">balance transfer credit card</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>The rewards hunter.</strong> Some of the choices here have wonderful rewards for a card requiring no credit history, but someone looking for uncapped cash back, enticing travel offers and other valuable rewards should look elsewhere. If the <a href="#">top rewards cards</a> aren‚Äôt in your credit range, a card here could be a great tool to grow your score along the way.</li>
    <li><strong>The on-their-way cardholder.</strong> If you‚Äôre someone who has experience as a cardholder but not too much success when it comes to growing your score, don‚Äôt be discouraged. There are <a href="#">cards for fair credit</a> and other options on the market that can help as you continue to improve your credit history.</li>
</ul>




<h3>How to make the most of your credit card</h3>
<p>When you‚Äôre starting out and building up your credit, your goal should be to match or exceed the 690 credit score target required to establish good credit. Here are a few tips to help you get there:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Develop healthy payment habits.</strong> When trying to build your credit, you should aim to pay off your balance on time and in full every month to avoid interest, or at least pay more than the minimum. Plus, you should plan to use less than 30% of your available credit limit at all times.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your account open and active.</strong> Responsible credit card use over time is a component that the credit bureaus take into consideration. Demonstrating a responsible credit history can go a long way towards boosting your score over time. While it might seem logical to never use your card if you want to keep utilization low, it may work against your credit-build goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Be meticulous.</strong> You can utilize credit monitoring tools offered by your issuer, bank or third-party sources to keep track of your score and check for any mistakes. If you do encounter any mistakes, you can dispute them to keep your credit report updated and accurate, which will help bolster your score.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate your options.</strong> When initially searching for a credit card, you‚Äôll want to consider if there is a path to a better credit card with the same issuer. After establishing a good credit history you may be able to upgrade to a better card with a higher credit limit and rewards rate while maintaining your line of credit. This is especially important for any cardholder wary of opening new card accounts.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-watch-for-section">Factors to look for in your first credit card</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôve made up your mind to get your first credit card in 2024, you‚Äôve come to the right place. However, with hundreds of credit cards in the market, it can be overwhelming to decide which card you should get first. We can help with that. For example, you‚Äôll need to look at which type of card you want (or can get); whether there are fees; and what rewards are offered. We‚Äôll walk you through the different types of cards and what you should pay attention to.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Credit reporting.</strong> Does the card issuer report to the credit bureaus? This is a deal-breaker because if the issuer doesn‚Äôt report to the bureaus, you won‚Äôt be able to improve your credit with the card.</li>
    <li><strong>Fees.</strong> Are you clear about the fees? Look at not only the better-known fees in the ‚ÄúSchumer Box,‚Äù such as late and returned payment fees, but also fees lower in the text, including ‚Äúbilling statement copy fee‚Äù and ‚Äúexpedited telephone payment fee.‚Äù Make sure you won‚Äôt be nickel-and-dimed with your new card.</li>
    <li><strong>Types of cards</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secured.</strong> This card requires a refundable deposit, typically starting at $200, but available as low as $49. This is a good card for someone with <a href="#">bad credit</a> or no credit.</li>
            <li><strong>Unsecured.</strong> Most cards are unsecured, which means there is no required deposit. There are some unsecured cards available for consumers just starting out.</li>
            <li><strong>Student.</strong> These cards are usually geared toward students or recent graduates with benefits designed to promote responsible use.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewards.</strong> The ultimate goal for many is to work toward a rewards card, which typically requires <a href="#">good</a> or <a href="#">excellent credit</a>. These cards come with the industry‚Äôs best cash back or points rates and may include some extra credits and perks that bring more upfront value.</li>
            <li><strong>Gas.</strong> Gas cards typically require lower credit and, sometimes, loyalty to specific brands. Some are co-branded, but they‚Äôre all part of a card network, such as Visa or Mastercard, which allows you to use the card anywhere the network is accepted.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Qualification requirements.</strong> Check that you have a high likelihood of landing the card before applying, because every time you apply for a card, it impacts your credit score by about 5 points. Using tools like our <a href="#">CardMatch</a> feature can help sort it out beforehand.</li>
    <li><strong>Annual fee.</strong> While this isn‚Äôt necessarily a deal-breaker, you‚Äôll want to pay attention to make sure it‚Äôs something you can afford and that it‚Äôs worth your while.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest rate.</strong> While it‚Äôs usually a bad idea to carry a balance on your credit card, because you‚Äôll pay interest charges if you do, you‚Äôll want to pay attention to the APR, just in case.</li>
</ul>

<p>People with no credit may not be able to qualify for a top-tier product right away, but, after they demonstrate responsible use, they can look into an upgrade.</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúYou‚Äôll start building a positive credit history within a month of signing up for your first credit card, as long as you pay the bill on time,‚Äù says Ted Rossman, industry analyst at CreditCards.com. ‚ÄúYou should also try to maintain a utilization ratio (credit used divided by credit available) below 30%. After about six months, you should be able to upgrade from a secured card or another type of starter card to a card with even better terms and more lucrative rewards.‚Äù</blockquote>

<h3>Why establishing a credit history matters</h3>
<p>If you rent your home, pay a mortgage, lease or finance a vehicle, drive, pay utilities, need to take out a loan or find a job then your credit score and history matter.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs because the list of people who care about your credit score goes beyond just credit card issuers and lenders. Employers, landlords, even utility companies make decisions based on how you handle credit.</p>
<p>Here are some primary ways credit can affect your world:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Insurance.</strong> Your insurance company looks at your credit when deciding how much your premiums should be.</li>
    <li><strong>Credit card.</strong> When you are on the hunt for a credit card, your first stop needs to be a card that will likely accept your credit score ‚Äì anything above will only set you up for rejection.</li>
    <li><strong>Mortgage or car loan.</strong> Perhaps the best-known reason for why credit matters, lenders look at your credit to decide which product, if any, to grant you, as well as product terms. That means the higher your score, the better the terms, usually.</li>
    <li><strong>Job.</strong> While potential employers can‚Äôt check your credit without your approval, companies are increasingly studying job applicants‚Äô credit history before making a final decision.</li>
    <li><strong>Apartment.</strong> Landlords may look at potential tenants‚Äô credit when making a decision on which renter to accept.</li>
    <li><strong>Utility and cellphone accounts.</strong> Utility and cellphone companies check your credit before making a call on whether to require a down payment and in some cases, whether to accept you as a customer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How old do you have to be to get a credit card?</h3>
<p>You can apply for a credit card once you turn 18, but you will need proof of income or a willing co-signer in order to get approved. Issuer requirements get a little less stringent once you turn 21, though they will still consider your income and credit history during the application process. Evaluating the following can help you when trying to get a credit card as a young adult, student or recent graduate:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Do you have credit files?</strong> The first thing you should do when you turn 18 is to check your credit files with the 3 major credit bureaus, TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. You want to make sure that a) you even have a file and b) that the file is accurate. Have the bureaus correct any incomplete or inaccurate information. You shouldn‚Äôt have a file if you don‚Äôt have any credit accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Do you have income?</strong> If you are under 21, you are required by the <a href="#">Credit CARD Act of 2009</a> to have your own income if you want a credit card of your own.</li>
    <li><strong>Could you be an authorized user?</strong> If you don‚Äôt have your own income or your credit file is too thin (not enough credit information), look into being an authorized user on a responsible consumer‚Äôs credit card account. You are not legally responsible for the bill, but you benefit from their good credit habits. Also, unlike co-signing, it‚Äôs easy to be taken off an account as an authorized user. A couple of things to know about being an authorized user:
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the holder of the account pays on time and in full every month.</li>
            <li>Keep track of your credit reports and scores to make sure they are on track.</li>
            <li>Work toward getting your own card, because the benefits from being an authorized user last only as long as you are on that account.</li>
            <li>Not all card issuers report authorized users‚Äô credit habits to the 3 major credit bureaus, so check before you are added to the account.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="our-methodology-section">How we picked the best credit cards for people with no credit</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Credit-building perks.</strong> The main goal of a card for people with no credit is to grow credit scores. We made sure the cards here had perks to improve credit score, such as flexible schedules and reporting payment habits.</li>

    <li><strong>Miscellaneous benefits and features.</strong> While secondary to credit-building features, rewards rates and categories are a long-term feature to consider. Plus, you‚Äôll want to evaluate the card‚Äôs credit monitoring tools and ability to improve your credit line.</li>

      <p>One‚Äôs credit report, or history, is created by the three credit reporting bureaus, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. FICO, VantageScore and other scoring systems generate credit scores based on information submitted to them by banks, collections agencies and other creditors.</p>
      <p>Financial institutions may use both credit reports and credit scores to make decisions about lending. For credit cards, your issuer typically uses your credit score but not your credit report to inform decisions on approvals, APR and credit limits.</p>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Having no credit history and having bad credit are two different things. An individual with no credit is typically someone who is just starting out while someone with bad credit means that they‚Äôve possibly made some financial missteps and are thus considered more risky to lenders.

You may also look into a service that reports your rent or utility payments to the three credit bureaus (known as self-reporting) or a credit scoring model such as UltraFICO or Experian Boost that use expanded criteria to determine creditworthiness. Plus, if you have a car loan, student loan or personal loan, be sure to be diligent about making your payments on time as loans count towards your payment history.</p>
