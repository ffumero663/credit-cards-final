              <li>With a good credit score, you may be able to qualify for even more lucrative travel and everyday rewards cards, many of which boast far more impressive perks.</li>

  <h2 style="font-size: 26px;" id="credit-card-good-credit-details-section" class="section-offset" >Editor’s picks: Credit cards for good credit details</h2>
  <h3>Best for cash back: Citi Double Cash® Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Citi Double Cash offers 2% cash back in a unique way: 1% on general purchases (excluding gift cards) and then an additional 1% cash back as you pay off those purchases. With no annual fee, there are no category restrictions or rules to follow, so earning cash back is simple and easy to track.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you take advantage of the balance transfer opportunity, there’s an intro balance transfer fee of 3% or $5, whichever is greater, for balance transfers completed within the first 4 months of account opening.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</a> takes the flat-rate 2% cash rewards credit card to the next level by also offering an intro APR on both purchases and qualifying balance transfers. Learn more about <a href="#">how to pick a 2% cash back card</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Thanks to its simplicity, this cash back card is a good fit for someone who values freedom and flexibility. The card is also a solid choice, particularly for existing Citi customers already familiar with earning ThankYou points. If you have credit card debt to combat, the intro APR window on balance transfers could be a valuable perk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best backup card: Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> With the Quicksilver, you won’t have to settle for a credit card that only offers 1% back on general purchases, charges foreign transaction fees (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>), and lacks perks like extended warranty, travel accident insurance, and complimentary concierge service. This no-fuss card also packs in a generous sign-up bonus and a notable intro APR period on purchases and balance transfers.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The 1.5% cash back rate isn’t the most lucrative flat-rate option, and there is a 3% balance transfer fee that applies to any balance transfers you make during the intro period.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards credit card</a> offers cardholders the power to choose their highest earning spend category, in addition to offering high flat-rate rewards in other key categories.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The intro APR offer and 1.5% rewards rate make the Quicksilver a great fit for anyone who wants to make headway on eliminating debt and interest-free payments on purchases for a short time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for groceries: Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Your everyday spending on groceries, gas, transit and even streaming services could help you rake in hundreds of dollars in cash back — enough to offset the card’s ongoing annual fee after the first year and still come away well ahead in cash back rewards.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card’s ongoing annual fee and spending cap on U.S. supermarket purchases could put the card out of reach for households with larger budgets.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you don’t spend enough to justify an annual fee, the <a href="#">Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express</a> is a solid pick that offers cash back rewards on your purchases made at U.S. supermarkets and U.S. gas stations. If your spending habits fall more in line with groceries and entertainment, the <a href="#">Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> is a great pick.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card is one of the best rewards cards around as long as your everyday spending lets you take full advantage of as many of the cash back categories as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>


<h3>Best for good credit habit incentives: Upgrade Cash Rewards Visa®</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The way this card works is a bit unique. Visa combines elements of a credit card with elements of a personal loan – cardholders make purchases that are automatically rolled into an installment plan with a fixed monthly payment. Designed to help cardholders get into a routine, this structure could spare you from overspending or underpaying your balance each month.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Some cardholders might enjoy a low APR, but some may not, given the high-end of the APR range is fairly steep. There are also limited additional benefits, so if you don’t have a hard time keeping balances under control, you’re likely better served by a traditional cash back credit card.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Chime Credit Builder Secured Visa® Credit Card</a> goes further than most secured credit cards. It doesn’t require a credit check or a minimum security deposit and doesn’t charge interest.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’ve struggled with paying off credit cards in the past, this personal loan/credit card hybrid could be an extremely helpful tool. Those looking to rebuild credit will appreciate the ability to earn consistent cash back.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Upgrade Cash Rewards Visa review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>


<h3>Best for Walmart rewards: Capital One Walmart Rewards® Mastercard®</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You’ll earn the most on Walmart.com purchases (including pickup and delivery orders). You’ll also earn at a competitive rate on in-store Walmart purchases and Walmart fuel stations, restaurants and travel purchases. Finally, you’ll get 1% cash back everywhere else. There’s no minimum to redeem rewards, no foreign transaction fee and your rewards don’t expire. Another plus: You could get instant approval via the Walmart App.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card carries a high variable APR range and there’s no sign-up bonus or introductory APR.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If Walmart isn’t your go-to, one-stop shop, you may prefer a general-purpose credit card you can use at a variety of stores. One of Amex’s Blue Cash credit cards, such as the <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</a>, could be a better fit for people who shop at a variety of U.S. supermarkets.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If Walmart is your go-to for groceries, gas or any other need, this card can pack a punch with its high-yielding cash back offers for no annual fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One Walmart Rewards® Mastercard® review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>


<h3>Best for Delta airlines: Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Travelers have access to Delta’s large network of airline partners, there’s no blackout dates on Delta flights and miles don’t expire.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Frequent flyers looking for comfort and additional perks won’t get lounge access or reach elite status with this card.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> is a better fit for people who don’t fly Delta often or who aren’t frequent travelers. Though it has a $95 annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>), the sign-up bonus, unlimited reward earning potential and numerous other perks will go a long way to bringing down the costs of your next trip.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Anyone frequently flying with Delta should take a long look at where the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card can take you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Delta SkyMiles Gold American Express Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>


<h3>Best for frequent hotel stays: Marriott Bonvoy Bold® Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Your earnings from the sign-up bonus are worthwhile towards Marriott stays. Also, for no annual fee, you get automatic Silver Elite Status and have the ability to transfer points to 40+ airline partners. You also have access to the world’s largest hotel network.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The available redemption options outside of room awards generally have poor value, and this card’s overall rate for earning points is comparatively low.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Reward seekers who want a travel credit card with more value should consider upgrading to the <a href="#">Marriott Bonvoy Boundless® Credit Card</a>, which has a $95 annual fee. The sign-up bonus and points you earn on purchases made at hotels participating in the Marriott Bonvoy program are higher, and there are numerous other perks that you won’t find with the Bonvoy Bold card.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Marriott enthusiasts looking to earn some perks with the brand while skipping an annual fee should consider this card.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Marriott Bonvoy Bold Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>


<h3>Best for frugal families: Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Blue Cash Everyday is a no-annual-fee card with great cash back rates. It comes with a lengthy intro APR on new purchases and balance transfers.

<h3>Best for GM rewards: My GM Rewards® Mastercard®</h3>

    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The intro bonus requirements are easy to meet and this card is ideal for GM fans. There’s also a modest intro APR offer on purchases, which is a plus.</li>

    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> General-purpose cash back credit cards or cards that earn flexible points are the way to go if you’re not in the market to buy or lease a GM vehicle.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you plan to buy or lease a new car or truck in the future, GM offers some eye-catching incentives to get people to consider its lineup of vehicles. Points you earn never expire and you can redeem toward numerous GM products and services like new GM vehicles and vehicle maintenance.</li>

<h3 id="good-credit-score-section">What is a good credit score?</h3>
<p>
  A good credit score using the <a href="#">FICO credit-score model</a> is 670 to 739 out of a range of 300 to 850. Using the <a href="#">VantageScore model</a>, a good credit score is 661 to 780. According to FICO data from credit bureau Experian, <a href="#">21% of consumers have good credit</a>, while 34% have bad or fair and 45% have very good or exceptional credit.
</p>
<p>
  With good credit, you can enjoy not only better lending products but lower insurance rates, improved rental options and even better job opportunities. With bad credit, you’ll tend to get stuck with higher interest rates and inferior rewards.
</p>

<h3>What determines good credit?</h3>
<p><a href="#">Good credit</a> means that your score is high enough to qualify for better financial products.</p>

<p>The scoring models look at several factors to see if you are a good credit risk. The higher your score, the less risk you are for the lender. Below we have listed the primary factors that scoring models focus on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Paying on time.</strong> The most important aspect of your credit score is on-time payments. It makes up <a href="#">35% of your FICO score</a>, the score most used by lenders to assess your creditworthiness. One late payment can drop your score to the next range, although the older that late payment gets, the less impact it has. This category is also the most important factor for VantageScore, the scoring model developed by the three major credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.</li>
    <li><strong>Paying in full.</strong> This category makes up 30% of your FICO score. It looks at the amount of credit you have available compared to the amount you owe. That’s called your <a href="#">utilization ratio</a>. For example, if you owe $100 and you have $1,000 in available credit, your utilization ratio is 10% – you want the percentage as close to zero as possible. The amount of credit used is considered highly influential in the VantageScore model.</li>
    <li><strong>Credit history.</strong> How old are your accounts in your credit file with the three credit bureaus? This makes up 15% of your FICO credit score and is highly influential with VantageScore.</li>
    <li><strong>Recent credit.</strong> Avoid applying for multiple credit cards at once, because that can negatively impact your score, although a single pull typically only impacts your score by about five points. Recent credit makes up 10% of your FICO score and falls under “less influential” on VantageScore.</li>
    <li><strong>Credit mix.</strong> FICO likes it when you have different types of credit, such as revolving credit (cards) and installment credit (car loans and mortgages). It makes up 10% of your FICO score and is highly influential in VantageScore.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the difference between good and fair credit?</h3>
<p>Per FICO, a fair credit score falls in the 580 to 669 range, just below what qualifies for good credit.</p>

<p>Having a good credit score will create better financial opportunities than a fair score. A good credit score helps earn the trust of lenders and other major decision makers, often leading to more affordable plans with better terms and rates. This will come in handy when looking for a home, rental property, personal loan, new job, and more.</p>

<p>Those with fair credit scores are sometimes only given access to unfavorable terms because they’re deemed riskier. This is why it’s important to practice good financial habits like making on-time payments and not using too much of your available credit.</p>

<p>If your score needs a boost, <a href="#">cards for fair credit</a> can help. When used responsibly, they can improve your credit score and show lenders your good financial habits. They may also come with extra features and benefits to enhance their value. These may include a sign-up bonus, cash back rewards, and free credit score and credit monitoring.</p>


<h3 id="maintain-good-credit-section">How to maintain good credit</h3>
<p>In some ways, maintaining good credit is more difficult than building because one false step can drive your score down to the next tier. Here are a few tips for maintaining your credit:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Make reminders or use autopay:</strong> You know you need to pay on time and in full each month. So you don’t forget, set up a reminder to help you remember to pay by the due dates. Also, some credit cards allow you to set up automatic payments, so there’s no worry whether your bills are paid on time.</li>
    <li><strong>Make a small payment:</strong> Even if you don’t use a card much, make a small payment each month to keep the account active.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t close accounts:</strong> Typically it’s a good idea to keep accounts open and active because available credit with a low balance helps your score. Even if you don’t use a card much, make a small purchase each month or so and pay it off to keep the account active.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep a budget:</strong> Allowing for saving and fun, maintain a workable budget to ensure you don’t overspend on your credit card.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="our-methodology-section">How we picked the top credit cards for good credit</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Rewards program:</strong> The best credit cards for good credit offer rewards as incentive to use the card. So we looked for credit cards that offer high points, miles, or cash back rewards for a variety of everyday purchases. We also looked to see if the redemption policies are easy to understand.</li>

    <li><strong>Redemption options and flexibility:</strong> We considered whether the credit card provides multiple options for redemption, including the usual methods (statement credit, direct deposit to bank account, or check) as well as alternative options (travel purchases, gift cards).</li>

    <li><strong>Sign-up bonus:</strong> A good sign-up bonus can help maximize the value of a credit card for good credit. So we looked to see if there is a sign-up bonus and considered the amount of the bonus as well as the required spending threshold.</li>

    <li><strong>Rates and fees:</strong> It’s important to pay attention to the interest rate you’ll be charged. Interest charges are how credit card companies make money, and that’s how people fall further into debt. That’s why we look to make sure the regular annual percentage rate (APR) is reasonable compared to the current industry average. (<a href="#">See the current average credit card interest rates.</a>) We also looked to see if the card has any other fees (annual fee, penalty fees) and whether the rewards and benefits are enough to make the potential fees worth the cost.</li>

      <h5>How long does it take to build good credit?</h5>

    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Whether you’re starting from scratch or recovering from a financial misstep, you may be wondering how long it will take to build your credit. While it will not happen overnight, you can establish a good credit score in three to six months when paying on time and in full while maintaining a low utilization ratio. One can take steps to achieve this by using a credit card, becoming an authorized user on another person’s account or paying off an installment loan.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>While there is no quick fix to reach your credit goals, taking consistent action over even relatively short periods of time is essential for boosting your score. First, create a plan to tackle any debt you’ve accrued as it won’t be doing your score any favors. If you have a loved one who is a responsible credit user with an existing credit account, ask if you can be included as an authorized user, which can improve your score when that card shows up on your credit report. Finally, take advantage of self-reporting. Programs such as UltraFICO allows users to demonstrate their creditworthiness by adding histories of on time payments for loans and utilities to their profile.</p>
