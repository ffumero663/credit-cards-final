        A <a href="#">foreign transaction fee</a> is a common charge that your credit card issuer adds to your bill for purchases made outside of the U.S. Usually around 3% of the purchase price, foreign transaction fees can apply to travel purchases when you are physically outside of the United States, as well as online purchases with foreign merchants.
        <br>
        <br>
        The good news is that there are plenty of credit cards that waive foreign transaction fees. Some credit card issuers, like Capital One and Discover, have no foreign transaction fees on any of their cards.
        <br>
        <br>
        Keep reading to learn more about how foreign transaction fees work and how to avoid them. Below you’ll find the top offers from our partners, followed by a full list of editor picks.

                  While not unreasonable for a card of this caliber, the $95 annual fee means you'll need a strategy to maximize the value of the rewards and benefits.

                        You can redeem points as statement credits for any travel purchase made within the last 12 months, which is a long window compared with many other cards.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        No foreign transaction fee means that you don't have to worry about the cost of currency conversion when you use it overseas, and no annual fee means low cost of ownership.

                        If you have a favorite airline or hotel chain, you can earn much higher rewards rates with a co-branded airline or hotel card.

                      The Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card is a strong choice for people who like minimum hassle. Preferred Rewards members will get the most value.

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The flat-rate cash back program means you don't have to track special categories, worry about earning limits or adjust your spending based on calendars.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Easy and flexible redemption options include the Capital One App, which lets you redeem cash back as statement credits applied to purchases made within the previous 90 days.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Flat-rate cash back has its appeal, but the question of scale still applies. Using a card with bonus rate categories, you can earn comparable cash back without spending nearly as much.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The sign-up bonus ($200 when you spend $500 in the first three months) is easy to obtain but many competitors have richer welcome offers.

                        Redeeming your points for travel through Chase Travel℠ increases their point value by 50%, which is how you can turn 60,000 points into $900 for travel instead of $600.

                      <li>
                        Loyalty can be more than its own reward. Every year on your account anniversary, you qualify for an up to $300 travel credit to reimburse you for travel purchases.

                        For some, the $550 annual fee could induce sticker shock. You'll need to travel frequently and take advantage of the many benefits and perks to offset that annual expense.

                      <li>
                        The list of Chase travel partners isn't as extensive as those of some competitors and tilts more toward airlines than hotels.

                      <li>
                        Similar to the Amex Gold Card, you'll get opportunities to maximize the value of Uber. In this case, the benefits are Uber VIP status and up to $200 in Uber cash on rides or food orders in the U.S. every year (benefit renews annually).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        You'll get twice as much time as the industry standard to earn the welcome offer: 80,000 Membership Rewards Points after spending $8,000 with your new card in your first six months of card membership.
                      </li>

                        The $695 annual fee, steep even for a premium travel card, might seem like the elephant in the room. Instead of ignoring it, though, you can focus on how to counteract it with the rewards and the long list of perks and benefits.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Speaking of perks and benefits, Amex typically has very specific conditions and enrollment requirements that can make them seem overcomplicated.

                        By earning 1.5X Miles on all eligible purchases, travel-related or not, you can earn a considerable amount of rewards without being a globetrotter.

                      <li>
                        One of Discover's trademarks is its aversion to fees. This card doesn't charge foreign transaction fees or annual fees, among others.

                      <li>
                        If you feel that convenience and versatility have a value all their own, a card that offers a travel booking portal and transfer partners might be a better choice.

                        Also earns rewards at a high rate at U.S. supermarkets, making it a terrific option for frequent travelers, restaurant-lovers and home cooks alike.

  <h2 style="font-size: 26px;" id="credit-card-section" class="section-offset" >Editor’s picks: No foreign transaction fee credit card details</h2>
  <h3>Best for flat-rate rewards: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Venture Rewards’ sign-up bonus is straightforward and plentiful: earn 75,000 bonus miles once you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. It does come with a $95 annual fee, but this card also offers high rewards in bonus travel categories and 2X miles on all other purchases, plus convenient features like a <a href="#">Global Entry/TSA PreCheck</a> credit and easily transferable miles.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The Venture’s list of airline partners in the U.S. is limited.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card</a> has a rewards program that isn’t as simple or flexible, but it will likely provide more value if you are willing to book your travel through Chase Travel.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Big spenders who regularly go abroad will find a lot to love about the versatile Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card beyond the sign-up bonus.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>
  

  <h3>Best for sign-up bonus: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This top Chase credit card has everything you need in a travel rewards credit card. Cardmembers get a generous base rewards program of 5X points on travel purchased through the Chase Travel℠ portal, 3X points on dining and 2X points on other travel purchases (1X points on general purchases). There’s also a lucrative sign-up bonus and of course, no foreign transaction fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The spend required to earn the bonus may be out of reach for someone on a tight budget. Plus, you’ll need to redeem your points for travel through <a href="#">Chase Travel℠</a> to get the best value.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The Sapphire Preferred offers the biggest bang for your buck when you redeem for travel through Chase Travel℠, but the <a href="#">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> will be the better option for travelers who like flexibility and want to keep things simple when it comes to earning and redeeming rewards.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re on the hunt for one of the <a href="#">best travel credit cards</a> and you don’t mind paying a modest annual fee, the Chase Sapphire Preferred allows you to accrue Ultimate Rewards points quickly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Read our <a href="#">Chase Sapphire Preferred Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

  <h3>Best for flexible travel: Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Bank of America Travel Rewards credit card makes travel rewards even more accessible by allowing you to redeem your points as a statement credit for any travel or dining purchase made on the card within the last 12 months. Plus, you can earn 25,000 welcome bonus points after spending $1,000 in purchases within the first 90 days of card membership. On top of all that, there’s no foreign transaction fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The rate for cash redemptions is disappointingly low at 0.6 cents per point.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you like to travel, you could get more value by upgrading to a card with a modest annual fee. The <a href="#">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> has a more robust rewards program and a bigger sign-up bonus. It costs $95, but that fee is easily offset through strategic spending. (Read more about how you can easily offset this annual fee in our review.)</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> With an easily attainable welcome bonus and flexible flat-rate rewards program, this is a great card for travelers who can’t be bothered to keep track of spend categories. Bank of America customers can earn even more through the <a href="#">Bank of America Travel Center</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>


<h3>Best for no annual fee: Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The VentureOne offers travelers a 1.25X miles rate on all purchases, plus no annual fee. Miles don’t expire for the life of the account, and there’s no limit to how much you can earn with this card. To welcome new cardholders, Capital One awards 20,000 bonus miles after spending $500 in the first three months (a $200 value towards travel).</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Travelers may feel a tad underwhelmed by the list of airline partners, which so far excludes any major domestic carriers.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card</a> is also a no-annual-fee credit card that won’t charge foreign transaction fees. But it edges out the VentureOne Rewards with its unlimited 1.5 points per dollar spent on all purchases.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Anyone with good or excellent credit (a score of 670 or higher) who is on the hunt for a rewards card with no annual fee and no foreign transaction fee  will want to take a look at the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>



<h3>Best for streamlined rewards: Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Quicksilver is an easy-to-understand rewards card: It gets unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases and has a sign-up bonus of $200 for spending $500 in the first three months. As an added welcome, this flat-rate card offers a 0% intro APR offer on purchases for 15 months (19.74% - 29.74% variable rate thereafter) (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>) – a perfect window to purchase a trip to be paid off in increments while temporarily avoiding interest. In addition, this card charges no annual fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Its flexible rewards and intro offer make this an easy-to-use card, but there are more valuable rewards out there for experienced cardholders.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Thanks to a flat cash rewards rate of 2%, you might get more value on your everyday expenses with the <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</a>. But you’ll miss out on paying no foreign transaction fees as the Active Cash card comes with a 3% fee for foreign currency conversion.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Travelers with good or excellent credit (a score of 670 or higher) who prefer an uncomplicated rewards program will be pleased with the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card, which charges no foreign transaction fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for rotating bonus categories: Discover it® Cash Back</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> One of a select few offering its level of rewards, the Discover it Cash Back offers 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in combined spend each quarter on rotating categories such as restaurants, wholesale clubs, and even online retailers (activation required). After hitting the $1,500 threshold in a quarter, the rewards rate drops to 1% (the same as all other purchases).</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Due to limited international availability, travelers should research whether Discover is accepted where they’re traveling.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Chase Freedom Flex®</a> also has 5% cash back in rotating categories. But it also has fixed rewards rates in numerous bonus categories, including 5% cash back on travel purchases through Chase Travel℠ and 3% on dining and on drugstore purchases. Unfortunately, you’ll have to pay a 3% foreign transaction fee if you plan to use it for overseas spending.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Discover it® Cash Back is a versatile cash back card that is a good match for travelers willing to be strategic in their spending. But if you think you’ll have difficulty keeping up with rotating categories, you might be better served by a <a href="#">flat-rate credit card</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Discover it® Cash Back review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for point value: Chase Sapphire Reserve®</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Unlike most, this card features an annual travel credit of $300 for cardholders to spend anywhere in the world. And when purchased through the Chase Travel℠ portal, you can earn 10X points on hotels and car rentals as well as 5X points on air travel. You can even earn 3X points on other travel and dining purchases and 1X points elsewhere. (The 10X, 5X and 3X travel rewards rate only applies after you earn your $300 travel credit.) And here’s the kicker: Points are unlimited, don’t expire and receive a 50% boost on travel rewards when redeeming through the <a href="#">Chase Travel℠ portal</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This is a well-rounded card, but it comes with a high annual fee of $550. And despite the versatile redemption options (including travel, cash, and gift cards), there is a lower rewards value when you redeem for cash, gift cards or merchandise than when you redeem for travel booked through Chase.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Depending on your spending habits and the level of premium features you’re looking for, the <a href="#">Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card</a> could be a better fit. It has a smaller annual fee and still packs a punch when it comes to luxury perks like lounge access and annual travel credits. Learn more about the <a href="#">Capital One Venture X vs. Chase Sapphire Reserve</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Chase Sapphire Reserve® is for jetsetters who spend enough on dining and travel to justify the high annual fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Chase Sapphire Reserve® review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for lounge access: The Platinum Card® from American Express</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> With the Platinum Card in your wallet, you’ll enjoy access to the <a href="#">Global Lounge Collection</a>, with Amex states over 1,300 airport lounges in 140 countries. The high-end card also offers flexibility while traveling, with 5X points on flights booked directly with airlines or with American Express Travel (earn 5X points on up to $500,000 on these purchases per calendar year) and 5X points on prepaid hotels booked with American Express Travel. This option also features unlimited points that won’t expire, a welcome offer of 80,000 points after a $8,000 spend within the first six months and no credit card foreign transaction fees (<a href="#">see rates and fees</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The Platinum Card does not come cheap – bringing along a $695 annual fee. If your spending habits align with the impressive list of credits and perks that are worth over $1,000, you’ll have no trouble making up that fee. But that immense value starts to drop if you aren’t interested in things like memberships at Walmart or Equinox gyms.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you want luxury but don’t want to pay such a steep price, you’ll want to consider the <a href="#">Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card</a>. It has a smaller annual fee of $395 (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>) and is a solid pick if you like lounge access and only need a limited amount of luxury perks. Learn more about the <a href="#">Capital One Venture X vs. American Express Platinum Card</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Those willing to shell out the $695 annual fee will certainly get their money’s worth in top-notch travel perks including lounge access, Hilton Honors gold status and a number of handy travel related statement credits. If you’re constantly on the go, these benefits can be enormously useful.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best for annual credits: Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Compared to other premier travel rewards credit cards, the Venture X’s modest annual fee and unlimited miles on all purchases, along with all the other bonuses and perks, make it an instant challenger for the best credit card of its class.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The $395 annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>) and $4,000 spend requirement within three months of account opening to earn the 75,000 bonus miles should be considered carefully before applying for the Venture X.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> With an annual fee of $695, <a href="#">The Platinum Card® from American Express</a> isn’t cheap, but some travelers looking for luxury may prefer the convenience of Amex’s Membership Rewards program, as well as the opportunity to earn the Platinum Card’s welcome offer.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is a great option for anyone who travels often, uses their credit card regularly, and will take advantage of as many of the Venture X’s perks as possible. This includes the yearly bonus and travel credit, cellphone protection, and free lounge access.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best for travel beginners: Discover it® Miles</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The lack of annual fees, foreign transaction fees and miles limits, plus the flexible redemption options make for a powerhouse travel card for beginners.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> While this may not be a total dealbreaker for budget travelers and new cardholders, miles can’t be transferred to airline loyalty programs.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you spend a lot on travel and dining, consider upgrading to a travel card with a modest annual fee ($95). The <a href="#">Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card</a> costs $95 a year, but compared to a basic travel card, it can help you to maximize the amount of rewards you earn while also providing enhanced benefits like an annual hotel credit, trip cancellation and trip-interruption insurance and a complimentary DashPass subscription (<em>when you activate by December 31, 2027</em>).</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re looking for a travel credit card but don’t want to get locked into confusing points offers or an annual fee, the Discover it Miles may just have what you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best for restaurants worldwide: American Express® Gold Card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> If you’re a foodie, this card’s generous rewards rates at both restaurants worldwide and U.S. supermarkets should make it easy to earn travel rewards on the purchases you make every day. Add in the value of its annual dining credits and Uber Cash and you can easily justify this card’s $325 annual fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The annual fee likely won’t be worth it unless you take advantage of its dining credits and redeem points for travel. If you’re looking for a lower-maintenance card, a no-annual-fee rewards card is probably a better option.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> is a great no-annual-fee option (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>) for foodies and cash back fans. You’ll earn rewards on dining, grocery stores, entertainment and more and can redeem for cash back or travel without worrying about point values.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card is a great value if you want to earn travel rewards and benefit travelers who spend a good bit at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets and prefer to redeem rewards on travel versus cash back.</li>

<h3>Best for starter travel perks: American Express® Green Card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> It comes with credits for Loungebuddy lounge access and Clear Plus — two practical benefits that offer a ton of value, even if you only travel occasionally. It also carries one of the most generous rewards rates out there on transit purchases.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Amex cards are less likely to be accepted abroad, so it could be risky to rely on this as your only card for international travel. Its perks will also fall short if you’re looking for unlimited lounge access worldwide — Loungebuddy isn’t available at all airports and the credits included with the card will only cover a few lounge visits.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Believe it or not, the <a href="#">Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card</a> could be an even better deal, despite its high annual fee of $395 (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>). That’s because the Venture X comes with unlimited Priority Pass and Capital One lounge access for cardholders, an annual travel credit and anniversary bonus miles — enough value to easily offset the fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Thanks to its practical, high-value perks, this card should be worth it even if you only take a few flights per year.</li>

<h3 id="what-are-foreign-transaction-section">What is a foreign transaction fee?</h3>
<p>Foreign transaction fees are charges that credit card issuers and payment networks place on purchases made in a foreign currency or on purchases that involve a foreign bank. A foreign transaction can be a purchase processed through a foreign bank (such as when you buy something from a non-U.S. retailer website) or when you travel overseas, including when you use an ATM. Note that there can actually be multiple fees at a foreign ATM, including a flat-rate international ATM surcharge as well as an ATM access fee.</p>
<p>Usually, a credit card foreign transaction fee is around 3% of the purchase price. Of that 3%, your card issuer typically charges 2% for processing the transaction and the remaining 1% is for converting the transaction from one currency to another. To put this in perspective, a $100 purchase would cost you an additional $3 in foreign transaction fees.</p>

<h3>Which credit cards work internationally?</h3>
<p>You won’t have trouble using your credit card at home. In the U. S., the four major credit card networks – Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover – have an acceptance rate of 99% or higher among merchants who accept credit cards. But it’s a different story overseas.</p>
<p>According to their respective websites, Visa, Mastercard, and Discover are accepted in over 200 countries and territories around the world. But Visa and Mastercard are more widely accepted at over 70 million merchant locations compared to <a href="#">Discover’s network</a> of over 50 million merchants. And while American Express has made great strides to increase its international presence beyond 160 countries, it still doesn’t match the power of Visa or Mastercard.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean your Discover or American Express card won’t provide tremendous value when traveling abroad or making purchases with a foreign bank. It’s just a good idea to have a backup plan, which should include carrying a Visa or Mastercard, as well as your debit card for cash withdrawals and that rare occasion when a merchant doesn’t accept any credit card.</p>

<h3>How to avoid foreign transaction fees</h3>
<p>The easiest way to avoid foreign transaction fees is to use a credit card that doesn’t charge for overseas purchases. Why? Typically, in terms of convenience and security, <a href="#">credit cards are the best payment method.</a></p>
<p>When you use a credit card with no foreign transaction fee, you don’t just avoid an unnecessary fee that eats into your budget. You’ll have an easier time <a href="#">disputing credit card charges</a> than you will debit card purchases or items paid for with cash. Your credit card may also come with built-in protections like extended warranty and purchase protection.</p>
<p>In addition to being safer to use, credit cards are also accessible, meaning anyone can avoid foreign transaction fees. There are credit cards that charge no foreign transaction fee for every credit score range. Take a look at the following cards that charge no foreign transaction fee, no annual fee, and offer a number of valuable consumer protections:</p>

  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 style="color: #004C3F; border-bottom: 1px solid #004C3F;">Pros of a no foreign transaction fee credit card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>You can rack up rewards:</strong> Some credit cards with no foreign transaction fees offer cash back rewards on popular spending categories in addition to travel cards offering points and miles.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>You’ll have access to travel perks:</strong> Along with base rewards and no foreign transaction fees, premium travel credit cards typically offer trip cancellation insurance, supplemental auto insurance, free checked bags, airport lounge access and other notable amenities.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>You’ll get a fair exchange rate:</strong> When you get your statement after buying something with a credit card in a foreign country, you’ll see that the charge has been converted to U.S. dollars. Your payment network will take care of the conversion, and you can usually be confident that you’re getting a fair exchange rate.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Cons Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 style="color: #9B2E2E; border-bottom: 1px solid #9B2E2E;">Cons of a no foreign transaction fee credit card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>You may need to pay an annual fee:</strong> Annual fees are common among mid-tier and premium travel credit cards, which often don’t charge foreign transaction fees. When evaluating whether to get a card that carries an annual fee, it’s important to determine whether that fee can be offset or recouped with reward earnings, added perks, or if you can shoulder the added cost.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Your payment network may not have coverage:</strong> While <a href="#">Visa and Mastercard</a> payment networks seem to be everywhere, some regions don’t accept certain credit card networks. When it’s time to travel, take credit cards from at least two different networks and always have cash on hand.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Who Should Get Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 >Who should get a no foreign transaction fee credit card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The frequent international traveler:</strong> If you travel abroad somewhat regularly, credit card charges for foreign currency transactions can have a significant impact on your personal finances.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The international online shopper:</strong> You don’t necessarily have to travel in order to rack up foreign transaction fees. For someone who routinely shops at international online shops, those fees can really sting, especially once you factor in foreign shipping expenses.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Who Should Skip Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should skip a no foreign transaction fee credit card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The balance carrier:</strong> Some cards in this category have APRs that are usually on the higher end of average, which can mean a lot when it comes to carrying a balance on the card and what purchases you make abroad. Make sure to be aware of what you’ll be charged if you can’t pay your bills off in full each month.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="make-the-most-of-your-card-section">How to make the most of a no foreign transaction fee credit card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Contact your bank before you travel.</strong> Make sure to notify your bank before you travel, as banks will often freeze an account on suspicion of fraud if they detect unusual activity, such as a purchase being made thousands of miles from the cardholder’s address.</li>
  <li><strong>Come prepared with multiple cards. </strong> Whether you’re traveling domestically or abroad, your ability to use a credit card at a merchant depends on whether the merchant accepts that card’s payment network. If you’re planning to travel internationally and your primary card is <a href="#">American Express</a> or <a href="#">Discover</a>, it’s best to bring along a Visa or Mastercard as a backup.</li>
  <li><strong>Know how your rewards programs define “travel.”</strong>It’s important to pay attention to the specifics to <a href="#">get the most from your rewards credit card.</a> Many rewards cards offer bonus points on smaller travel purchases, but issuers have their own definitions of travel. Some issuers put expenses such as rideshares and parking fees in the travel category, while others don’t.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="foreign-transaction-fees-by-issuer-section">Foreign transaction fees by card issuer</h3>
<p>Below are the standard credit card foreign transaction fees for top issuers. Some issuers, like <a href="#">Capital One</a> and Discover, elect not to charge a foreign transaction fee on any of their credit cards. Of course, even different cards from the same brand can vary in their fees.</p>

<h3>Do I need a chip-and-PIN card for foreign transactions?</h3>
<p>It’s a good idea for overseas travelers to have a <a href="#">chip-and-PIN card,</a> but not necessarily a requirement.</p>
<p>Until a few years ago, U.S.-issued cards were swiped using magnetic stripe technology. Now, like Europe, our credit cards have an <a href="#">EMV chip.</a> What happens after you insert the chip differs depending on where you are. While U.S. merchants will usually ask for your signature, European merchants may ask for a four-digit PIN.</p>
<p>The PIN provides an added layer of security and may be required at some overseas vendors — for example, at European train kiosks. Nowadays, however, most merchants can bypass the pin portion of the transaction if you don’t have one.</p>
