        There are plenty of factors to consider when deciding which airline card is best for you. First things first, you want to choose a card that is co-branded or at least partners with an airline that offers frequent service to your nearest (or preferred) airport. You should also have a sense of what you’re looking for in terms of card perks and realistically assess whether those perks align with both your spending and travel habits.

  <h3>Best general airline credit card: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You can really rack up travel rewards with this popular travel credit card from Capital One. The Venture Rewards Credit Card offers unlimited 2X miles on every purchase and 5X miles on hotels, vacation rentals, and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. You can also earn rewards from everyday purchases that you can use toward flights with a wide range of airlines, including over 15 partners that allow you to transfer points 1:1. You can also use your rewards for statement credits for other travel purchases.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The current list of airline travel partners doesn’t include other large U.S. carriers. There’s a $95 annual fee not waived the first year (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The Citi Strata Premier<sup>SM</sup> Card offers a higher rewards rate in several spending categories, including restaurants, gas stations, and supermarkets, at 3X points. Plus, you can earn a total of 10X points per $1 spent on hotel, car rentals, and attractions booked on the Citi Travel portal.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you travel frequently but don’t always fly the same carrier, this general-purpose travel credit card might give you the most bang for your buck. Airline loyalists may prefer to go with a co-branded airline card.</li>

<h3>Best for luxury travel perks: The Platinum Card® from American Express</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The popular premium card from American Express comes fully loaded with luxury travel benefits, including top-tier travel insurance, perhaps the most comprehensive airport lounge access available, and elite hotel perks like complimentary hotel loyalty status with Marriott and Hilton.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The $695 annual fee is a big commitment, so carefully consider whether you travel enough to justify the price. Some of the travel credits come with caveats that make them tricky to track or maximize, like the $200 Airline Fee Credit per year that can only be used on one select airline.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The American Express® Gold Card comes with similar perks but at a lower annual fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card ticks off all the boxes for big spenders and frequent travelers looking for luxury travel perks, particularly complimentary airport lounge access. However, the high annual fee can be hard to justify unless you travel frequently.</li>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The $395 annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>) is a bargain compared to other premium credit cards, but it might still be too much for some.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> While the Chase Sapphire Reserve® does have a higher annual fee than the Venture X, it also offers more in terms of redemption value—50% more when redeeming for travel with Chase.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card is a great fit for travel enthusiasts with excellent credit who plan to take advantage of enough premium benefits to make the annual fee worth it, but prefer streamlined travel miles.</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> There’s a lot going for this travel card, including considerable rewards and few restrictions— all with no annual fee. For example, earn 1.5X points on all purchases. The lack of an annual fee means you don’t have to track your earnings to ensure you’re getting your money’s worth.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You won’t get a boost by redeeming points for travel through the Bank of America Travel Center. Points redeemed for cash are worth only 0.6 cents each.</li>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re committed to avoiding an annual fee, this general-purpose travel card is one of your best options, so long as you’re okay with forgoing fancy travel perks.</li>

It offers 5X points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠, 2X points on other travel purchases, and 3X points on dining, select streaming services, and online grocery purchases. You’ll also receive 10% of your total purchases last year back as annual bonus points. All points can be redeemed for 25% more value toward Chase Travel℠ or be worth 2 cents each on average with the right <a href="#">Chase transfer partner</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card’s $95 annual fee might price this card out of a frugal traveler’s budget.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you have a tendency to spend heavily on travel, the <a href="#">Chase Sapphire Reserve® card</a> is a higher-end version of the Sapphire Preferred, with a $300 travel credit, airfare, baggage fees, and more. Although it carries a $550 annual fee, the perks could be worth it for some.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you travel frequently but don’t fly with a specific carrier, this card can offer a good return on flights and more. However, travelers on tighter budgets might prefer a no-annual-fee card.</li>

<h3>Best for Southwest Airlines: Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card</h3>

Perks such as 3,000 bonus points and EarlyBird Check-Ins can make up for the card’s $69 annual fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Southwest doesn’t have airline partners, so the rewards are only valid for Southwest flights.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card</a> offers a similar rewards value with a broader flight network, potentially making it more attractive to some travelers.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Rapid Rewards Plus is a good starter card for Southwest flyers. However, if you don’t fly Southwest often or prefer international travel, this card might not be the best fit for you.</li>

Cardholders also earn 20,000 miles if they spend $500 in the first three months, which is equal to $200 in travel rewards. There's no minimum to start redeeming rewards.</li>

(<a href="#">Learn how to decide between the Capital One Venture cards</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Even if you only travel occasionally, the higher-tier <a href="#">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> may be a better value overall thanks to its better flat rewards rate (2X miles) and valuable perks like an up to $120 credit for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card but can’t justify its annual fee or aren’t sure if you’ll travel enough to make it worthwhile, consider this card a solid alternative.

<h3>Best for American Airlines: American Airlines AAdvantage® MileUp® Card</h3>

American Airlines offers one of the largest travel networks in the world, and AAdvantage miles (valued at 1 cent*) can be transferred to dozens of airline, hotel, and car rental partners.</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Redeeming AAdvantage miles can be complicated; you’ll have to navigate blackout dates and award seats may be limited.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The Bank of America Travel Rewards credit card also has no annual fee and doesn’t limit you to one airline. Cardmembers earn 1.5X points on all purchases, which can add up quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This is a great starter airline credit card for people who fly American Airlines, or those who do not live near an American hub but want to keep loyalty with the airline.</li>

You’ll also receive a companion fare from $122 ($99 fare plus taxes and fees from $23) each year on your account anniversary (after you spend $6,000 or more on purchases within the prior anniversary year).</li>
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks: </strong>The card carries a $95 annual fee, so be sure you fly Alaska Airlines enough for the long haul to justify adding it to your wallet.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives: </strong>With a slightly lower annual fee ($69 versus $95), the Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus card can help you earn a Companion Pass if you aren’t able to fly with Alaska Airlines often. However, it’ll take much more work since you’ll need to earn 135,000 qualifying points or fly 100 qualifying one-way flights with Southwest per calendar year to be eligible for the airline’s Companion Pass offer. You’ll earn a 10,000 qualifying point head start each year as a Southwest cardholder.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom line: </strong>If you fly Alaska Airlines with a companion even once or twice a year, you’re likely to appreciate this card’s benefits.</li>

<h3 id="how-do-ariline-cards-work-section">What are airline credit cards and how do they work?</h3>
<p>Airline credit cards are typically aligned with airlines to bring you rewards specific to that brand, although there has been a movement in the last year to offer boosted general rewards as well. Called co-branded cards, these products reward you for loyalty to that brand through in-flight purchases and tickets, as well as brand-specific benefits.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you’ll want to pick a card partnering with an airline you’ll actually use, or there’s no point in earning all those miles. For example, American Airlines has a hub in Charlotte, while United has a hub in Houston, and Delta is based out of Atlanta. Where you live and go should factor into your decision.</p>
<p>“Airline cards are especially valuable when you’re loyal to a particular carrier,” says Ted Rossman, CreditCards.com’s industry analyst. “The miles you earn through a sign-up bonus and your ongoing spending can quickly earn you a free trip. Plus, airline cards often offer additional perks such as free checked bags and priority boarding. Many of them charge annual fees, but they can be recouped quickly. For example, a $95 annual fee equals roughly three checked bags. A family could come out ahead after just one flight.”</p>
<p>In addition to co-branded cards, there are general-purpose travel credit cards that partner with airlines for redeeming points or miles, such as Capital One Venture Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards.</p>
  
<h3>What is the difference between an airline credit card and a general travel credit card?</h3>
<p>Though they are both handy for travelers, there are clear differences between an airline card and a general-purpose travel card. For starters, an airline card offers rewards for loyalty to one specific carrier or alliance whereas a general-purpose travel card partners with multiple airline brands. If your closest airport happens to be a designated hub for a particular airline, you might find that airline’s branded credit card to be the most convenient.</p>
<p>With an airline credit card, you can often earn boosted rewards on travel and in-flight purchases. A general-purpose travel credit card tends to reward for a variety of categories, sometimes even offering rewards for all purchases. More recently, airline credit cards have begun to reward for everyday spending in categories such as groceries, although it isn’t nearly as common as with general-purpose cards. General travel cards also offer benefits such as Global Entry or TSA Precheck credits, while airline cards might offer complimentary checked baggage, seating upgrades and lounge access.</p>

  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 style="color: #004C3F; border-bottom: 1px solid #004C3F;">Pros</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Travel value:</strong> The points and miles you earn can be put towards future travel, and they’re especially valuable when used to book business class seats. However, you’ll still be on the hook for applicable taxes and fees.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Travel perks:</strong> Airline credit cards come loaded with valuable perks such as complimentary checked baggage, lounge access, and priority boarding, as well as coverage for lost luggage and trip cancellation.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Rewards are easy to earn:</strong> Depending on your spending habits, it’s relatively easy to rack up rewards. Plus, generous welcome bonuses give cardmembers a leg up on accumulating miles and earning status.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Cons Section -->

    <h3 style="color: #9B2E2E; border-bottom: 1px solid #9B2E2E;">Cons</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Points can be difficult to redeem:</strong> Airlines sometimes restrict the number of seats available per flight for those booking with rewards. Blackout dates also restrict when travelers can redeem points for travel, particularly during peak travel periods.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Loyalty can be limiting:</strong> If you have an airline-branded card, you’re limited to that particular carrier and its network of partner airlines. That’s why it’s important to choose an airline that is convenient for you to fly.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Perks often include caveats:</strong> While benefits like trip protection and lounge access can be helpful, some of these benefits come with a lot of fine print, which you need to be familiar with in case there’s a hitch in your travel plans.</li>

<h3 id="most-popular-airline-rewards-program-section">Most popular airline rewards programs</h3>
<h4>Delta SkyMiles</h4>
<p>While the <a href="#">SkyMiles program</a> is forever moving the finish line with fluctuating point values and rules, its range of redemption options and lack of blackout dates make it a crowd-pleaser. The average point value is 1.2 cents, according to Bankrate*, and rewards don’t expire. There are more than 20 airline partners, so you can go pretty much anywhere in the world on Delta and its SkyTeam partners. Loyal Delta flyers and international travelers will certainly find a lot to love about this program.</p>

<h4>United MileagePlus</h4>
<p>The <a href="#">United program award tickets</a> are one-way, which opens up your options in terms of how you choose to redeem. You can select seats in a different class in each direction; or you can travel out with a lesser Saver ticket when your plans are flexible, and with an Everyday ticket on the return with firmed-up plans.</p>
<p>You can use miles to request upgrades to a premium cabin, which allows you to benefit from free alcoholic beverages, as well as priority check-in, security line access, boarding, and baggage handling. The average point value is 1.1 cents each*.</p>

<h4>Southwest Rapid Rewards</h4>
<p>With this <a href="#">loyalty program of Southwest Airlines</a>, flight options are primarily limited to domestic destinations, which now include service to Hawaii. It’s also worth noting that its short-haul international service is rapidly expanding. Families with a tendency towards overpacking will appreciate the complimentary additional checked baggage.</p>
<p>Booking is flexible, and there aren’t a ton of hidden fees. Southwest Rapid Rewards are, on average, worth 1.5 cents a piece*. While there are no blackout dates and one-way trips are permitted, it’s not the largest of airlines. Southwest currently serves about 120 destinations, and only 11 countries.</p>

<h4>Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan</h4>
<p>OneWorld member Alaska Airlines offers travelers excellent value across the board, particularly in terms of earning potential, average airfares, and general service. Alaska is the fifth-largest airline in the U.S. with a focus on West Coast service, underserved markets in the Pacific Northwest, as well as Canada, Mexico, and Central America.</p>
<p>By Alaska’s math, Mileage Plan members earn 30% more miles than with other domestic loyalty programs. While Alaska’s fees are on par with other domestic carriers, its flexibility around ticket changes and rebookings makes it a favorite among flyers. The average point value is 1.1 cents each*.</p>

<h4>American Airlines AAdvantage</h4>
<p>With about 350 destinations to more than 50 countries, <a href="#">American Airlines</a>, with regional carrier American Eagle, is one of the largest airlines in the world. Its network of OneWorld partners makes it a strong choice for world travelers. The airline partners with OneWorld Alliance carriers as well as other partners.</p>
<p>While there’s the MileSAAver awards, which means you can book award flights at a low number of miles, there are downsides, such as some quirky rules and the need for flexibility when booking. American Advantage points are worth 1 cent each* on average.</p>

<h4>British Airways Executive Club</h4>
<p>OneWorld partner <a href="#">British Airways</a> can eat up your miles, called Avios, but the experience is superior. There is a feature called Reward Flight Savers, advertised as the best value reward flights, which is available on return flights in Europe and southern Africa. Like other loyalty programs, you can use Avios to upgrade, for a hotel stay or getting a rental car. Avios points are worth 0.7 cents each* on average.</p>

<h4>Virgin Atlantic Flying Club</h4>
<p>Flying to roughly a dozen countries, Virgin Atlantic is a 35-year-old British airline with a number of stops in the U.S. Flying Club, Virgin Atlantic’s loyalty program, offers dozens of partners, including Delta. You can redeem as few as 7,500 Virgin Points for a one-way flight through Delta. Other partners include KLM, Air France and other international airlines, as well as hotels such as Hilton and IHG.</p>
<p>The Virgin Atlantic Flying Club Virgin Points are worth a whopping 2.6 cents on average*. You can also convert rewards into Virgin Points through some of the top card issuer programs, such as Citi ThankYou and Chase Ultimate Rewards.</p>



<h4>Do airline miles expire?</h4>
<p>When it comes to airline rewards, few things are more frustrating than seeing your hard-earned <a href="#">points and miles</a> expire before you’ve had a chance to use them. Unfortunately, only a few airline rewards programs offer miles that never expire, with the vast majority requiring you to either earn or redeem miles within one or two years or risk forfeiting the miles in your account. In some cases, you can have expired miles restored to your account, but don’t be surprised if you’re asked to pay a reinstatement fee.</p>

<h3 id="maxmizing-an-airline-credit-card-section">How to make the most of an airline credit card</h3>

<h4>Consider how frequently you fly</h4>
<p>Simply put, if you don’t fly more than a couple of times a year, you probably don’t need an airline credit card. While some airline credit cards let you earn miles on everyday purchases, like gas or groceries, you generally get the most bang for your buck by redeeming for free flights. And while many cards have moved away from blackout or expiration dates on miles, you’re not likely to recoup the annual fee associated with most of these cards if you’re not cashing in your rewards each year or taking advantage of the ancillary perks a card entitles you to.</p>
<p>If your spending tends to vary, consider a general rewards credit card or a <a href="#">cash back credit card</a> instead.</p>

<h4>Identify your carrier of choice</h4>
<p>If you do fly frequently, consider next whether you tend to do so on the same carrier. (That’s generally dictated by whether you live near an airline hub or a major airport serviced by carriers with a large flight network.) If so, that brand’s airline credit card could help you earn award flights more quickly, qualify for elite status, and receive perks that let you travel in style.</p>
<p>If you’re more likely to fly on a variety of carriers throughout the year or you like to comparison-shop for deals across travel providers, consider a general-purpose travel credit card. We’re partial to the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, which offers 2X miles on general purchases and lets you redeem rewards as statement credits for a wide variety of travel expenses.</p>

<h4>Account for a card’s transfer partners</h4>
<p>Many general-purpose travel credit cards let you transfer your points to partnering airlines. Review their list of current partners to see if they’re in line with your travel habits. Transferring points is often a great way to get a bit more bang for your buck. Learn other <a href="#">ways to maximize credit card rewards</a>.</p>

<h4>Ask yourself if you check a bag</h4>
<p>Most airline’s charge $30 for a first checked bag and $40 for a second, so if you frequently travel with a suitcase, an airline credit card that lets you skip that charge can save you money or, at least, cover a card’s annual fee before you factor in the rewards.</p>


<h4>Decide if you’re looking for lounge access</h4>
<p>Some premium travel rewards credit cards offer access to a large number of airport lounges, irrespective of brand. The Platinum Card from American Express, for example, grants cardholders access to the American Express Global Lounge Collection®, which includes more than 1,400 airport lounges around the world. The Chase Sapphire Reserve, meanwhile, comes with complimentary access to <a href="#">Priority Pass lounges</a> in more than 1,300 locations around the world.</p>

<h4>Are airline credit cards worth it in 2024?</h4>
<p>If you travel frequently and tend to fly the same carrier each time, a good airline credit card could help you earn loyalty points (and, by extension, award flights) faster. They could also entitle you to benefits that make flying more enjoyable or cost-effective, like priority boarding, a free checked bag, elite status and upgrades, when available.</p>

<p>Although travel restrictions have relaxed compared to the past few years, it’s important to carefully consider how often you plan to fly in the future before deciding on whether to get an airline credit card.</p>

<p>Of course, if <a href="#">the card has no annual fee</a>, we say it’s a no-brainer. While you’re waiting around for your next trip to roll around, you may as well be accumulating points or miles to fund future getaways. If the card has an annual fee, you should make sure that your estimated yearly rewards and perk value <a href="#">makes up for the annual fee</a>.</p>

<p>When assessing whether or not an airline credit card is a good option for you, here are five things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You plan to regularly fly with the same airline</strong> – If you live near a hub of the airline partnering with the card you are eyeing, that might be a good card for you. Also, if you find yourself often turning to a specific airline for your travel needs, this card might be the right choice.</li>
  <li><strong>You will use the card’s perks</strong> – You’ll want to look at the travel features beyond just the miles offered. TSA PreCheck, free first checked bags, lounge access, cancellation insurance: These are a few of the features strong airline cards may offer.</li>
  <li><strong>The perks outweigh the annual fee</strong> – There’s often an annual fee with airline cards, so you’ll need to assess whether the rewards and the perks make the card worthwhile once the annual fee has been charged.</li>
  <li><strong>You have the credit score for the card</strong> – Airline cards typically require good or excellent credit (a FICO score of at least 670). There’s no point in applying for a card if you don’t have the required credit score, because applying will temporarily impact your score even if you don’t get the card.</li>
  <li><strong>You can pay the full balance each month</strong> – If you get any type of rewards card, airline cards included, it’s important to make sure you can pay your balance in full each month. Otherwise, any earned points or miles are basically eaten by the interest you’d owe.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="our-methodology">How we picked the best airline credit cards</h3>

<p><strong>Research methodology:</strong> We analyzed 148 airline credit cards to identify the best ones currently on the market. The major factors we considered in making our Editor’s picks include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rewards rates:</strong> The best airline credit cards offer at least 2X points on purchases with their specific carrier. General-purpose travel credit cards might offer between 1.25X to 2X miles on all purchases.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Rewards value:</strong> Not all miles are created equal. We looked at how much each mile was worth when redeemed for airfare. We also considered how much each mile was worth across additional redemption options, when available.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Ancillary airline perks:</strong> The best airline credit cards offer extra benefits, like a free checked bag, priority boarding, automatic elite status, airport lounge access or more. Many offer travel credits for items like <a href="#">Global Entry or TSA Precheck</a>. We weighted cards more heavily if they offered these types of benefits.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Rates and fees:</strong> Many airline credit cards charge annual fees and, as a rewards credit card, they tend to carry higher APRs than low-interest counterparts. However, we still considered if these costs were reasonable relative to the category and the benefits each card carried.</li>

        <li><strong>Capital One:</strong> Rewards post within 10 days, but may take up to two billing cycles to be redeemable (or, within one to two billing cycles after qualifying for the welcome offer)</li>
        <li><strong>Chase:</strong> Rewards quickly appear as “pending,” but may take until after the billing statement closes to be redeemable (or, within six to eight weeks after qualifying for the welcome offer)</li>

      <p>Like other rewards cards, you can earn airline points or miles through airline credit card spending.

      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Airline miles can be redeemed through your credit card issuer or directly through an airline. When logged in to the airline’s website with your loyalty account, you’ll find that flights are generally listed both by their dollar amount and by amount in miles, or sometimes you may have to toggle between the two.</p>
      <p>Miles redeemed through your issuer’s rewards portal can be booked for flights or hotels as well as other rewards such as cash back, gift cards, statement credits, or donations.</p>

      <h5>Can you transfer miles between airlines?</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>You can’t transfer points between frequent flyer programs in most cases, even if the airlines are partners. Partnerships such as OneWorld, Star Alliance, and SkyTeam typically allow you to earn miles when you fly on one airline, and redeem those miles you earn for flights on a carrier within the same network. However, most of those airlines won’t allow you to transfer miles directly from one carrier to another, because there is no financial benefit to them for doing so.</p>
      <p>But there are some exceptions to the rule. British Airways and Iberia share the Avios frequent flyer program. So while your points in each program remain separate and distinct, you can transfer them freely between the two.</p>
      <p>Just because you can’t transfer points back and forth, however, doesn’t mean that you are stuck with a single carrier for life. Most airlines within the major alliances will allow you to use your mileage stash with that brand to book award flights on partner airlines. For example, an American Airlines frequent flyer can use AAdvantage miles to book a flight on British Airways, and the cost of that ticket will be based on the American Airlines mileage award chart.</p>
