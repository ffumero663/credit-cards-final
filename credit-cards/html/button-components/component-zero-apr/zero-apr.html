      <p class="see-more-text-content">Zero-interest credit cards (or 0% intro APR credit cards) let cardholders make payments with no interest charges on purchases, balance transfers or both for a set period of time. Your entire payment (except for any fees) is applied to your balance. After the introductory period expires, you begin paying a predetermined interest rate.
        <br>
        <br>
        The best zero-interest credit cards tout long promotional APR periods, usually between 14 to 21 months, and can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest. But before you sign up for one, make sure you know what you’re getting into. Keep reading to learn more and to find the top offers from our partners.        <br>

          <ul>
            <li>Its intro APR offers curb interest for a little longer than a year, giving you plenty of time to pay off your balance or pay new purchases.</li>
            <li>The welcome offer for the first year can boost your cash back even more, giving this card great upfront value.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Could charge an indefinite penalty APR if you fail to make a minimum payment by your due date or a payment is returned.</li>
            <li>Charges late payment and returned payment fees of up to $40, as well as foreign transaction fees.</li>

          <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
          <p>The Chase Freedom Unlimited could be great for earning cash back in a handful of boosted categories, and for scooping up bonus cash back for purchases not included in any rewards category. But its ongoing APR is relatively high, making it a less-than-ideal card if you carry a balance beyond your intro APR period.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 26px;" id="zero-interest-credit-card-details-section" class="section-offset" >Editor’s picks: Zero-interest credit card details</h2>
<br>
<h3>Best for long intro APR: Wells Fargo Reflect® Card</h3>
<br> 
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> It offers one of the longest introductory APR offers on purchases and qualifying balance transfers on the market.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You must transfer a balance within 120 days of account opening to qualify for the introductory APR. The card also has a balance transfer fee of 5% (minimum $5).</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Citi Double Cash® Card</a> has better long-term value than most credit cards that come with long intro APRs, offering a flat-rate cash back on purchases. It doesn’t have an intro APR offer on purchases, but it does offer a long intro APR offer on balance transfers if you’re looking to pay off credit card debt.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you suspect you’ll need an extra-long window to pay off a large purchase or a qualifying balance transfer, this card should be top of mind.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best for rotating category rewards: Discover it® Cash Back</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> One of the <a href="#">best rewards credit cards</a> on the market, this card’s rotating categories lets users earn high rewards in a variety of seasonal areas. It also comes with an intro APR offer on new purchases and balance transfers and a unique sign-up bonus that matches all the rewards you earn at the end of your first year.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Rotating categories that you have to enroll in can be a hassle for some people. Some may also prefer to earn rewards in their favorite categories year-round instead of quarterly.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Depending on your spending habits, you may get more value from the <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</a>. Though it has an annual fee of $95 ($0 intro annual fee for the first year), instead of quarterly bonus categories, you have the chance to earn an impressive amount of cash back all year in popular household categories, including U.S. supermarkets, select U.S. streaming services, U.S. gas stations and transit.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Discover it® Cash Back is a solid pick for someone looking for a credit card with well-rounded benefits, a potentially low go-to APR, and a competitive cash back rewards program.</li>

<h3>Best for versatility and long-term value: Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Active Cash packs in a lot more value than most flat-rate cash rewards cards. On top of earning unlimited 2% cash rewards on eligible everyday spending, members also enjoy an intro APR offer, generous welcome bonus, and a variety of redemption options.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Depending on spending habits, some may be better served by a card that allows you to maximize earnings in specific categories. It’s also important to note that the intro APR on qualifying balance transfers must be made within the first 120 days as a cardholder to receive the special intro rate.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> To get even more value out of the Active Cash Card, consider pairing it with a credit card that offers high rewards in bonus categories that fit your everyday spending. One example is to use the <a href="#">Citi Custom Cash® Card</a> to earn high cash back on your biggest eligible spend area, like gas, and then use the Active Cash Card for all of your other purchases.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The flat rate of 2% cash rewards on purchases alone makes the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card a worthy addition to any wallet.</li>

  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Families on a budget can get a lot of value out of this card.

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The 3% rewards are capped at $6,000 in purchases per year in each category, then drops to 1%.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> also has an intro APR offer for both purchases and balance transfers but offers 3% cash back in more bonus categories, including dining.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> On top of the intro APR offer, the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express offers an impressive cash back rewards program for no annual fee.</li>

<h3>Best for unlimited + everyday rewards in popular categories: Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card offers better short and long-term value than most intro APR credit cards. On top of the rewards you earn in popular household and entertainment categories, there’s also a sign-up bonus with a low spend requirement.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you don’t qualify for the low end of the regular variable APR rate, you could get hit with high interest rates on any balances carried over from month to month once the intro APR offer ends.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you spend more on groceries than you do dining, consider the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express. Although it has an annual fee after the second year, it offers an impressive amount of cash back at U.S. supermarkets, plus a statement credit welcome offer and a slew of other perks worth considering.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This versatile card is a great option for modest spenders looking to earn rewards in popular food and entertainment categories.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best for no annual fee: Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Quicksilver Cash Rewards has more than just a long intro APR to help you make interest-free payments on purchases and balance transfers. Like the best <a href="#">Capital One credit cards</a>, you also get a sign-up bonus, a chance to earn rewards on all of your purchases, and a number of travel and consumer benefits.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Despite its versatility, this card doesn’t earn the highest rewards or offer up the longest intro APR offer. If you need as much time as possible to pay off purchases or credit card debt or you want to earn a higher flat rate for all your purchases, you’ll need to look elsewhere.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</a> has a lot in common with the Quicksilver Cash Rewards card, but goes a bit further with 2% cash rewards on your purchases.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards card is a good fit for someone looking for a card that can do more than provide an intro APR offer.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best for everyday household spending: Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The high earning rates on U.S. supermarkets, U.S. gas stations, and select U.S. streaming subscriptions round it out as a go-to cash back machine for the modern household. Plus, its intro APR offer means you can cut down on interest costs for a considerable time.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Its annual fee after the first year is $95 and its U.S. supermarkets category has a $6,000 yearly spending cap, then the rate drops to 1%.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you don’t want to worry about an annual fee, consider this card’s little sibling, the <a href="#">Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express.</a></li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re the head of a large household, you will probably find plenty of value in the Blue Cash Preferred.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best unlimited cash back for Preferred Rewards members: Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This flat-rate card offers both versatility and value. You’ll earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all eligible purchases and have one of the longer intro APR offers for balance transfers and purchases.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Carry a balance beyond the introductory period and you could wind up paying quite a bit in interest, especially if you fall under the higher APR range. Some may be better served by a card that offers a high rewards rate on bonus categories aligned with their spending habits.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Unless you’re a Preferred Rewards member, you’ll get better value out of a card that offers a flat rate of 2% cash back on all purchases. Or, depending on your spending habits, a card like the <a href="#">Chase Freedom Unlimited</a> may be more to your liking thanks to multiple categories that earn bonus rewards, followed by 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This unlimited flat-rate card has broad appeal, but anything less than 2% cash back on eligible purchases might be a disappointment to rewards seekers looking to capitalize on credit card perks.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best for tiered cash back: Chase Freedom Unlimited®</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Tiered cash back rates in common spending categories give cardholders ample opportunities to earn cash back while benefiting from generous intro APR periods for both purchases and balance transfers. You can manage debt and plan a pay-off strategy while you focus on maximizing rewards for routine spending.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Its ongoing APR is relatively high, so you’ll want your payments to keep pace with your spending once your intro period ends.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> You may be able to earn a comparable amount of cash back with the <a href="#">Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card</a> if your top spending category is dining and you shop regularly at grocery stores. Grocery budgets are arguably larger than gas and drugstore budgets, so you could potentially earn more cash back with the Customized Cash Rewards card if you have a focused spending strategy.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Chase Freedom Unlimited card has generous cash back rates and modest intro APR on purchases and balance transfers. However, be wary of its ongoing APR, which could be slightly higher than other cards’ on this page.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best for business owners: Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card’s flat cash back rate and welcome offer are two of the best reasons to choose this as your intro APR card.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Although it has a generous rewards program, welcome offer, and an intro APR on new purchases, there’s no intro APR for balance transfers.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you like this card’s flat rate, you might want to consider a consumer card like the Wells Fargo Active cash card, which has a more generous flat cash rewards rate. However, if it’s a longer intro APR and lower ongoing APR you’re looking for, then the BankAmericard® credit card offers one of the longest intro APR you’ll find on both purchases and balance transfers.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Business owners shouldn’t limit their credit options to business cards, but the Ink Business Unlimited is a great all-around pick for a generous mix of cash back, a welcome offer, and an intro APR period.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best for Introductory APR on purchases + cash back: Citi Custom Cash® Card</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This flexible, low-maintenance card doesn’t just have a nice intro APR. It also comes with a sign-up bonus and a chance to earn 5% cash back in your top eligible spending category. That’s one of the highest rates you can earn in areas like gas, groceries, or dining.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You’ll pay a steep fee for balance transfers. Plus, there’s a cap on your cash back, which eats into the card’s value.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> For a lot of people, the <a href="#">Chase Freedom Flex®</a> will come out on top, thanks to a similar intro APR offer, high rewards in multiple bonus categories, and a slightly smaller spending requirement to earn the sign-up bonus. To learn mroe, check out the <a href="#">battle of the 5% back cards.</a></li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The intro APR offer and chance to customize your cash back rewards make the Citi card a great option.</li>

</ul>

<br>

<h3>Best for flexible cash back categories: Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards credit card</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> On top of the intro APR offer, this card offers a lot more flexibility than most rewards cards. You can choose one bonus category from a long list of popular, everyday options and even change it once a month if you think you’ll spend more in another area. You can also earn a nice flat rate on your grocery purchases, including wholesale clubs, which typically only earns 1% on traditional rewards cards.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The $2,500 quarterly spending cap for the 2% and 3% combined categories (then 1%) may not be enough for big spenders, especially <a href="#">Bank of America Preferred Rewards members.</a></li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If your spending aligns with the <a href="#">Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card</a>, it will give you more food-and-entertainment categories to earn 3% cash back in.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card has great short- and long-term value for people on a budget, but big spenders could earn more rewards with other options like a flat-rate card.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best for balance transfer: Citi® Diamond Preferred®</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> If paying off debt is your top priority and you have good or excellent credit, the Citi Diamond Preferred Card could be a lifesaver. The card comes with an extremely long 21-month introductory APR offer on balance transfers completed within the first 4 months, after which your APR is a relatively low 17.74% - 28.49% (Variable).</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The lack of a base rewards program limits this card’s long-term value. Plus, the balance transfer fee (5% of your balance or $5, whichever is higher) will cost consumers more than the standard 3% fee found with other cards.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you think you can pay off your balance transfer faster than 21 months, the versatile <a href="#">Citi Double Cash® Card</a> may be a better choice. Its intro APR offer isn’t as long, but it has better value thanks to a rewards program that earns up to 2% cash back on purchases (1% when you buy and 1% as you pay).</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Citi® Diamond Preferred® Card is best for someone focused on paying off debt and who isn’t looking for a rewards credit card that offers points or miles.</li>

  <br>

<br>

<h3>Best for GM dealerships: My GM Rewards® Mastercard®</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The 7X points on eligible GM products and services is impressive, but even the 4X flat rate on general purchases is a phenomenal rate that gives you plenty of chances to rack up points on everything you buy.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Your points are only valuable if you redeem them for eligible GM purchases. Using your rewards on gift cards drops the value of your points from 1 cent to just 0.25 cents.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> A card like the <a href="#">Wells Fargo Autograph℠ Card</a> sacrifices some of the high earning potential but makes up for it with versatility. Cardholders earn 3X points in an impressive number of everyday categories and you can redeem points for cash back, travel and more at a value of 1 cent apiece.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This could be the card for you if you’re a GM loyalist looking to earn and redeem rewards at the dealership.</li>

<h3>Best for customizing rewards: U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You get more freedom than most rewards credit cards to choose how you earn high rewards in multiple bonus categories. This card can be a great option for people who want an intro APR offer and love earning as much cash back as possible in a variety of everyday categories.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> It can be a hassle remembering to choose and enroll in bonus categories each quarter. To earn the most value out of your purchases, you may need to juggle multiple credit cards to help offset the card’s spending cap.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</a> makes life a whole lot easier for rewards seekers. It lets you earn 2% cash rewards on your purchases without having to track your spending or enroll in bonus categories.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> There are a lot of opportunities to earn high rewards with the U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card, but it takes some work to get the most value out of this card.</li>

<br>

<h3>Best for Intro APR with rewards: Chase Freedom Unlimited®</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> There’s so much more to the Freedom Unlimited besides the intro APR offer for purchases and balance transfers. Cardholders can also earn a sign-up bonus and enjoy a rewards program that earns bonus rewards for travel booked through Chase Travel, as well as dining and drugstore purchases. And if you <a href="#">pair the Freedom Unlimited with other Chase cards</a>, you could increase the redemption value of the points you earn.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Anyone looking to travel or shop internationally will be disappointed by the 3% foreign transaction fee.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you spend more on food and entertainment, you might get more value out of the <a href="#">Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card</a>. It also has an intro APR offer but with more categories that earn 3% cash back, including at grocery stores (excluding superstores like Walmart® and Target®) and with select streaming services.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Chase Freedom Unlimited is a versatile credit card that will add a lot of value to your wallet long after the intro APR offer, especially if you travel often.</li>

<h2 id="what-are-zero-interest-credit-cards-section">What is a zero-interest credit card?</h2>
<br>
<p>When a bank issues a credit card, they charge the cardholder interest for borrowing money. However, to entice new customers, certain credit cards will offer promotional periods where the interest rate will remain at a fixed 0% for a defined period of time. This period with 0% interest (or whatever the promotional APR is) is referred to as the introductory APR period. After the promotional period has expired, the cardholder will be charged a different APR, which is considered the ongoing APR.</p>
<br>
<p>Because the cardholder does not incur any interest charges during the 0% APR promotional period, it offers a unique advantage to save hundreds, possibly thousands of dollars in interest fees. Cardholders may use a zero-percent intro APR card as a strategy for making a large purchase where they have several months to make interest-free payments or for transferring high-interest credit card debt so they can concentrate the entire monthly payment towards the balance.</p>
<br>
<p>While 0% interest credit cards usually require the cardholder to have a <a href="#">good or excellent credit score</a>, they can help you avoid additional costly interest charges.</p>
<br>

<h3>How do 0% intro APR credit cards work?</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <p>A card with a zero percent introductory APR allows you to either make purchases, complete a balance transfer or both without paying interest for a specified period. This period, typically anywhere from 12 to 21 months, is ideal for paying down debts without the burden of added interest charges. It could also help decrease the time it takes to pay off your credit card debt.</p>

  <br>

  <p>Once the 0% introductory period is over, <a href="#">ongoing APR</a> charges go into effect. This change means a new interest rate will apply to any purchases or balance transfers made after this time. It also means the ongoing APR will apply to any remaining balance not paid off during the promotional period.</p>

  <br>

<br>

<h3 >How much can you save with a 0% intro APR credit card?</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <p>A 0% intro APR credit card can save you hundreds of dollars, depending on how much you owe, your current APR, and how long it takes you to pay off your balance.</p>

  <br>

  <p>For an accurate picture, a <a href="#">credit card payoff calculator</a> can show you how long it will take you to pay off your debt and how much interest you’ll pay each month. This can give you an idea of how much you can save with a 0% intro APR credit card.</p>

  <br>

  <p>For example, what if you could pay off a balance in full using a credit card with a 21-month APR offer? Here’s how much total interest you could potentially save with 21 months of interest-free payments compared to a credit card with average interest and one with high interest.</p>

  <br>

<br>

<p>As you can see, a credit card with a 0% intro APR offer can save you a lot of money. Keep in mind that if you do a balance transfer, most issuers charge a fee that will be added to total balance, which will cut into your total savings.</p>

<h3>The different types of credit card APR</h3>
<br>
<p>APR is short for annual percentage rate and is the rate you’ll pay in interest if you carry a balance on your credit card. If you want to know more about <a href="#">how credit card APRs work</a>, one key thing to note is not all APRs are the same.</p>
<br>
<p>You’ll see various APR terminology throughout your card’s terms and conditions. The APR or interest rate may be different depending on how it is implemented with the card. For example, the regular, ongoing APR you qualify for is different from a penalty or cash advance APR.</p>



  <div class="rest-of-container">
  <br>
  <h4>Regular or ongoing APR</h4>
  <br>
  <p>Regular or ongoing APR is the standard interest rate issued to you for purchases with the credit card, when you carry a balance. The regular APR is often a variable rate, often determined by the federal prime rate and your credit score. The regular APR is the interest rate charged for purchases if there is no promotional APR offer.</p>
  <br>  
  </div>

  <div class="rest-of-container">
    <br>
    <h4>Purchase APR</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The purchase APR is the interest rate applied to purchases only. You’ll often find credit cards with promotional purchase APR periods, often for zero percent interest on purchases for a specified period of time. When the promotional period has expired, the rate will revert to the regular purchase APR for your card.</p>
    <br>  
  </div>

  <div class="rest-of-container">
    <br>
    <h4>Balance transfer APR</h4>
    <br>
    <p>A balance transfer APR is the interest rate applied when you transfer an existing balance from one credit card to another. Credit cards can offer a promotional balance transfer APR, typically zero percent interest for a balance transfer during a specified period. A card may offer either a zero percent purchase APR or zero percent balance transfer APR, but not both. Some cards do have intro APR offers on both, but the length of the offer may differ depending on where it applies.</p>
    <br>  
  </div>

  <div class="rest-of-container">
    <br>
    <h4>Cash advance APR</h4>
    <br>
    <p>A cash advance APR is the interest rate applied when you use a credit card for <a href="#">a cash advance</a>. It’s important to note the interest on a cash advance begins immediately accruing the day you receive the cash advance, and not at the end of a grace period the way a purchase APR does.</p>
    <br>  
  </div>

  <div class="rest-of-container">
    <br>
    <h4>Penalty APR</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Cardholders could activate a penalty APR when doing something to violate the credit card’s terms and conditions, such as making a late payment or having a returned payment for insufficient funds. The penalty APR will last for several months (according to your card terms) and is a higher-than-normal APR — in some cases double the regular APR.</p>

  <br>
  <h3>Are you planning a large purchase or paying down pre-existing debt?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Choosing the right card zero interest card may come down to one goal: paying down a pre-existing balance or financing a large purchase. While a zero interest card can save you money on interest payments for a defined period of time, especially for a large purchase, a balance transfer card may be better suited for those who need to focus on paying down an existing balance. If you’re concerned you’ll need to carry a balance for longer than the promotional APR period, then a low-interest credit card option may be better.</p>

  <br>
  <h3>What’s your payoff timeline?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Before selecting a card, understanding your payoff timeline could impact your decision. Not all introductory APR offers are created equal. Some have longer promotional periods than others, which may affect your payoff timeline if you hope to pay as little interest as possible. Keep in mind there are some introductory APR offers that only apply to purchases and may not include balance transfers. Once you have your payoff goal in mind, you can choose the card best suited for your timeline.</p>

  <br>
  <h3>Do you plan to use the card for the long haul?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Long-term financial plans should factor into your card selection. Ongoing features, like the annual fee, interest rates after the promotional APR period ends and rewards programs are key elements that could help decide what card you choose. For example, you should consider the ongoing APR to avoid hefty interest charges if you end up carrying a balance. If you do decide you no longer need your zero-interest card, carefully consider the impact before closing it. It’s possible closing a card can <a href="#">negatively affect your credit score</a> by raising your credit utilization and impacting the length of your credit history.</p>

    <h3>Who should get a 0% intro APR credit card?</h3>
    <br>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The plan-ahead spender.</strong> Whether you want to <a href="#">finance home improvements</a> or a dream vacation, a card with a lengthy 0% intro APR period can give you time to pay off your big purchase (typically 12 to 18 months) without incurring interest charges.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The balance reducer.</strong>If you carry high-interest credit card debt, you can transfer it to a credit card offering a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers. This gives you a window to make progress on reducing the debt itself, but be mindful of potential balance transfer fees.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The emergency spender.</strong>From car and home repairs to medical bills and lost wages – unplanned expenses and financial emergencies happen. If you don’t have enough money set aside in an emergency fund, a credit card with a 0% intro APR offer may be the last-resort option that can help get you through difficult times.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The credit novice.</strong>For people just getting started on their credit journey, a 0% intro offer may provide a more manageable way for easing into the new financial responsibility of credit card usage. Taking advantage of the 0% APR intro period not only gives you time to pay down your balance while you learn how to budget monthly payments, but many of these cards also offer a $0 annual fee for greater affordability.</li>

    <h3>Who should skip a 0% intro APR credit card?</h3>
    <br>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The rewards seeker.</strong>While some 0% intro APR credit cards do offer rewards, you can usually find more lucrative programs attached to traditional or premium rewards credit cards. </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The payment procrastinator.</strong>The 0% interest only lasts for the duration of the introductory period, and once it ends, the card will revert to its regular APR, which may not be low (based on your creditworthiness). If you tend to carry a balance month to month, a <a href="#">low interest credit card</a> could be a better option.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The heavy-debt consolidator.</strong>There are limits to how much debt you can transfer over to a credit card with a 0% intro APR offer. And if you can’t pay off that debt before the introductory period ends, your balance could get hit with high interest charges. If you’re carrying a heavy debt on multiple credit cards, a personal loan may be a better <a href="#">debt consolidation method</a> for you. </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The fee averse.</strong>While you can use a 0% APR intro offer as a smart financial tool, other fees attached to the card can quickly add up. It’s not uncommon for 0% APR cards to include balance transfer fees, ranging from 3% to 5% for each transfer, plus late payment charges or potential <a href="#">over-the-limit fees</a>. Foreign transaction fees are another possibility, where issuers charge a percentage of your purchase each time you shop with a foreign currency. </li>

<h2 style="font-size: 26px;" id="make-the-most-of-your-zero-apr-card-section" class="section-offset">How to make the most of your 0% intro APR offer</h2>
<br>
<h3>Plan large purchases around your intro period</h3>
<br>
<p>If you know you have an upcoming purchase to make, but may not have enough funds set aside, then taking advantage of an introductory APR period can bridge the gap between your spending and savings. You can finance your purchase with a zero interest card and make payments each month — ideally before the introductory period ends — allowing you the option to make smaller, more manageable payments over time.</p>
<br>
<p>Simply take the total purchase amount and divide it by the number of months left in your introductory period so you’ll know the minimum amount you must pay on the card each month to avoid interest charges and maximize your intro offer.</p>
<br>
<h3>Avoid adding to transferred balances</h3>
<br>
<p>Transferring an existing credit card balance to another card with an intro APR offer on balance transfers is a popular <a href="#">strategy for managing debt</a> and accelerating debt pay off. If paying off debt is your primary goal, it’s best to avoid adding any additional debt (such as new purchases) to your transferred balance. If you avoid adding to your transferred debt, you allow for the possibility of paying off your debt sooner. You can also take advantage of the introductory offer’s lack of interest charges — and put all your payments towards a balance and not the costly interest.</p>
<br>
<h3>Nail down a payoff strategy early</h3>
<br>
<p>Building a plan to <a href="#">pay off your balance</a>, even before you transfer any balances or make a purchase, can help you avoid costly mistakes. If you’re using your zero percent intro APR card for a balance transfer, don’t forget to include the balance transfer fee in your final balance. These fees, commonly 3 or 5 percent of the transferred balance, can add significantly to your payoff total. If you’re using an intro offer on a rewards card that carries an annual fee, be sure to account for that cost as you plan. Once you’re aware of your total balance, you can calculate a monthly payment that allows you to avoid interest or payoff within your ideal time frame.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pay off your balance within the intro period if possible</h3>
<br>
<p>The most effective way to use an intro APR period is to pay off your balance before the introductory period ends, which means you end up avoiding the interest charges. However, if this goal doesn’t fit within your budget based on the length of the intro period, or life gets in the way and you can’t pay the balance off as planned, the next best approach is to pay down as much as possible. If you choose a credit card with a lower ongoing APR once the intro period ends, then it could make things more manageable for when the interest charges do start.</p>
<br>
<h3>What happens when an intro APR offer ends?</h3>
<br>
<p>A 0% interest intro offer is great, but it’s also temporary. So, what happens when that offer expires? Ultimately, your card’s regular interest rate will kick in. Your card’s normal APR will apply to all new purchases and balance transfers that you make, and any balance that you are still carrying on your card. It’s imperative as you choose a zero interest card that you pick one with an ongoing interest rate you can manage if needed.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, say you transfer $3,000 to your new card and it has a 0% intro offer that lasts 12 months, and the regular APR is 20% after. If you only paid off $2,000 of your balance transfer before your 0% intro offer ends, your card’s standard APR, the 20%, will now apply to the $1,000 leftover.</p>
<br>
<h3>Alternatives to 0 percent APR cards</h3>
<br>
<p>If you’re worried that you won’t qualify for a 0 percent intro APR card or you want to avoid opening another credit card, you have a few options.</p>
<br>
<h3>Consider a debt consolidation loan</h3>
<br>
<p>With a <a href="#">debt consolidation loan</a>, you could combine debt from several sources into a single loan. The goal of consolidating is to end up with one affordable monthly payment. Debt consolidation loans are ideal if you need a longer payoff time or a lower interest rate. You’ll get a three-to-five-year payoff period with a debt consolidation loan while most 0% interest cards have intro offers that expire after 12 months on the low end or up to 21 months on the high end.</p>
<br>
<h3>Ask for a lower interest rate</h3>
<br>
<p>One way to save on interest is by asking your credit card issuer for a <a href="#">lower interest rate.</a> Your issuer isn’t guaranteed to grant your request; however, your odds of landing a lower rate increase if you have a good payment history and you’ve been a loyal customer. If you get better offers from competing cards and you share that information with your issuer, you might get a lower rate to retain your status as a customer.</p>
<br>
<h3>Look into credit card hardship programs</h3>
<br>
<p>If you’re struggling to pay your credit card bill each month, you can ask your credit card issuer if it provides a <a href="#">hardship program</a>. These programs vary, and not every provider will offer them to every cardholder. They’re also temporary, lasting at most 12 months. Your credit card issuer might freeze your account for the duration of the program to keep you from adding to your balances.</p>

<h2 id="our-methodology-section">How we picked the best 0% intro APR credit cards</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Research methodology: </strong>We analyzed over 1,000 zero-interest intro APR credit cards to identify some of the best offers on the market. The major factors we considered were:</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>0% intro APR period for purchases:</strong>Does the card allow you to skip interest charges on purchases for a set period of time? If so, how long does the offer last?</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>0% intro APR period for balance transfers:</strong>Does the card allow you to skip interest charges on a balance transfer for a set period of time? If so, how long does the offer last?</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Regular APRs:</strong>After the introductory period expires, are the purchase APRs or balance transfer APRs reasonable, relative to the current industry average?</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Balance transfer fee:</strong>Do you have to pay a fee to transfer a balance onto the new card to take advantage of the zero-interest offer? If so, is the fee reasonable relative to the industry standard?</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Overall card value:</strong>Does the card offer benefits once the introductory 0% APR offer ends? For no-frills cards, we considered whether continued use would cost cardholders an annual fee.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Other criteria used include other rates and fees, rewards rates, extra benefits and features, customer service, credit needed, ease of application and security features.</p>

      <p>A 0% intro APR card is an excellent way to budget for larger purchases or make a balance transfer without hefty interest charges, making it easier to lower debt – which may improve a cardholder’s credit score. However, like other credit cards, making late payments or carrying a high balance can impact a cardholder’s credit score in a negative way.</p>

      <p>You might be able to negotiate a lower interest rate with your card issuer, but you most likely won’t get an issuer to lower your rate to 0%. Issuers typically reserve 0% intro offers for new customers, and these offers are only temporary.</p>
      <p>If you do decide to negotiate a lower rate, your odds of success will be higher if you have a history of good credit habits. The issuer, however, is under no obligation to lower your rate.</p>

      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>No, deferred interest refers to making interest payments at a later date. The interest accrues after the purchase and until a specific date. The cardholder can avoid paying accrued interest by paying the balance in full before the date the interest comes due. Zero interest means a cardholder doesn’t pay any interest during the zero percent intro period. Once the zero percent intro period is over, the interest rate reverts to the regular APR.</p>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>It depends on the card and your spending habits. If the card charges an annual fee, consider closing the account so you aren’t required to pay each year. If you’re worried about overspending, consider closing the account so that you don’t run up new charges.</p>
      <p>But if the card offers a rewards program that matches your spending habits and has a low ongoing APR, you may consider keeping it open. Closing an account could hurt your credit score by changing your credit utilization ratio and reducing your credit age, so be sure to put some thought into the final decision.</p>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Issuers base interest rates on a few factors. One of the first large influences is an individual’s creditworthiness, which is a combination of credit history, income and total debt owed. But on a broader scale, the economy influences interest rates, too. Financial institutions tie interest rates to the prime rate, which in turn, is tied to the Federal Reserve’s target interest rate.</p>

      <p>Financial institutions use your credit score when evaluating your creditworthiness and determining how risky you are as a borrower.
