<h2  id="cash-back-credit-card-section" class="section-offset" >Editor’s picks: Best cash back credit card details</h2>
 
<h3>Best for 2% cash rewards: Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</h3>
  
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Wells Fargo Active Cash keeps it simple by letting you earn an unlimited 2% flat cash rewards rate on your purchases. No rotating categories. No enrollment. No need to think about which card to use for each purchase. </li>

   

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you’re assigned this card’s high-end APR, you could be stuck with hefty interest charges should you carry a balance beyond the introductory APR period. Plus, this card’s perks are limited compared to those of some pricier rewards cards.</li>

   

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you’re looking for a card with a generous base rate plus some additional perks, check out the <a href="#">Chase Freedom Unlimited®</a>, which earns at least 1.5% cash back on all purchases and allows you to transfer points to a higher-tier Ultimate Rewards card and redeem for travel at an up to 50% higher value.</li>

   

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Active Cash Card is a hassle-free credit card for people who value simplicity and consistent flat-rate cash rewards over earning high rewards in specific categories. </li>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Autograph℠ Card</a> offers 3X points in broader categories without any cap.</li>

<h3>Best for rotating categories: Discover it® Cash Back</h3>
 
<ul class="bullet-point">

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You need to activate the 5% bonus categories each quarter, and the categories are capped at $1,500 per quarter.</li>

   

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Consider the <a href="#">Citi Double Cash® Card</a> for consistent 2% cash back on all purchases without needing to track categories.</li>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> It doesn’t make sense as a general spending card, and higher rewards cards may suit larger spenders better.</li>

<h3>Best for flat-rate cash back: Citi Double Cash® Card</h3>
  
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Offering 1% cash back when you make purchases and an additional 1% back as you pay them off, the Citi Double Cash boasts one of the most competitive flat rewards rates available on a cash back card with no annual fee.</li>
  
   
  
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> There’s no intro APR offer on purchases, which differs from other top cash back cards that usually offer an intro APR on both purchases and balance transfers.</li>
  
   
  
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</a> offers the same flat rate of 2 percent cash rewards on purchases but stands out by offering an intro APR on both new purchases and qualifying balance transfers.</li>

<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card’s 6% cash back rate at U.S. supermarkets (up to $6,000 in purchases each year, then 1%) is one of the highest rates out there.</li>
  
   
  
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The $250 welcome offer is nice, but it comes with a sizable spending requirement compared to other rewards cards.</li>
  
   
  
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If you’re seeking an American Express card but are put off by an annual fee after the first year, the <a href="#">Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express</a> is worth a look.</li>
  
   
  
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Some may find the annual fee of $95 ($0 intro annual fee for the first year) a tad steep, but it’s worth remembering the card’s high rewards rates.</li>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Its flat cash back rate isn’t as high as other cards’ rates and its welcome offer is a bit weak compared to other cards.</li>
  
   
  
  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</a> is another great no-annual-fee card that gets 2% cash rewards on purchases, which could out-earn the Chase Freedom Unlimited, depending on your spending.</li>

<h3>Best for flexible cash back categories: Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card</h3>

  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You can change your bonus category once per calendar month, tailoring your rewards to your spending habits. It’s valuable, especially for avoiding an annual fee.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The $1,000 in spending required in the first 90 days to earn the sign-up bonus may be larger than some comparable cards. The $2,500 combined quarterly spend cap on 2% and 3% rewards could be limiting for big spenders.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card</a> lets you choose categories that offer up to 5% cash back with a combined $2,000 spend per quarter.</li>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> A $20,000 average balance is required for the Preferred Rewards boost, and reaching the top tier requires an average balance of $100,000.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</a> offers a flat 2% cash rewards rate and may be more rewarding for those with smaller account balances.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Best suited for people with large savings accounts. Others may find better flat-rate cash back options.</li>

<h3 id="what-are-cash-back-cards-section">What are cash back credit cards?</h3>
  
<p>Cash back credit cards are a type of rewards credit card. Other rewards cards may offer redeemable points or miles on purchases, but a cash back credit card gives a percentage of eligible purchases back to the cardholder.</p>
 
<p>Most cash back credit cards offer between 1% and 5% cash back on eligible purchases. The percentage you earn varies by card issuer. It can also depend on if the card earns more on certain categories, or the same percentage on all purchases. For example, if a card offers 2% cash back and you spend $1,000 on eligible purchases, your cash back potential would be $20.</p>
 
<p>Depending on the card, you’ll have numerous options for redeeming your cash back, including a statement credit to lower your balance or direct deposits into your checking or savings account.</p>

    <h3>How to calculate cash back</h3>
    <p>Exactly how much cash you earn back per purchase will vary depending on the terms of your card and the type of purchase you make. Let’s say you spend $500 each month in a category with a cash back rate of 5%. That means you earn $25 a month, just for card loyalty ($500 X 0.05 = $25). Sometimes there are spending limits, which is why it’s important to read through a card’s terms before applying.</p>

<h3>Types of cash back cards</h3>
 
<p>Since there are several different cash back cards, there’s likely one that suits your spending habits. Card issuers are privy to consumer spending patterns and flesh out cash back cards with different rates to compliment those patterns. This consumer-based approach amounts in a number of differently styled cash back programs on various amounts of cards, but overall there are typically three different kinds of cash back cards.</p>
 
<p>Here are the different types:</p>

 
 

<div class="accordion-container">
  <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
    <h5>Flat-rate</h5>
    <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How they work: </strong> <a href="#"> Flat-rate cash back cards </a>are probably the simplest type of rewards card you can get. With a flat-rate card, you’ll earn a set amount of cash back, usually between 1% and 2%, on every purchase. Simply set and forget earnings until you want to redeem your rewards.</li>
       
      <li><strong>Benefits: </strong>Depending on your spending habits, there’s the potential to earn quite a lot in rewards.</li>
       
      <li><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>On the flip side, you could also lose out on rewards by not using a card with bonus categories that you would frequently spend more than on everyday purchases.</li>
       
      <li><strong>Who they’re best for: </strong>Since there’s no need to strategize spending, this type of cash back card is great for first-time cardholders and those who want to use just one credit card for the majority of their expenses.</li>
       
      <li><strong>A great option: </strong>The <a href="#"> Citi Double Cash® Card. </a>Earn 1% cash back on general purchases (excluding gift cards) and an additional 1% as you pay off those purchases, effectively 2%.</li>
       
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="accordion-container">
  <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
    <h5>Tiered categories</h5>
    <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How they work: </strong>One of the best ways to maximize your cash back earnings is to use a tiered card for your most common purchases while using a flat-rate card for miscellaneous expenses. That way, you get the best of both worlds and you never have to settle for a low rate of cash back.</li>
       
      <li><strong>Benefits: </strong>Cash back rates for tiered categories can be quite high. If your card offers 3% to 5% cash back in supermarkets and you spend a lot on weekly grocery runs, you stand to earn a decent amount.</li>
       
      <li><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>If your card’s featured tiered categories are mismatched with your personal spending habits, you’ll miss out on cash back.</li>
       
      <li><strong>Who they’re best for: </strong>A cash back card with tiered categories is a great choice if you have regular expenses within particular categories, like gas or groceries.</li>
       
      <li><strong>A great option: </strong>the <a href="#">Chase Freedom Flex℠</a>. Earn 5% cash back on rotating bonus categories that you must activate each quarter (on up to $1,500 per quarter, 1% thereafter), 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% cash back on dining and 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.</li>
       
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-container">
  <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
    <h5>How much debt can I transfer with a balance transfer card?</h5>
    <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
    <ul></ul>
      <li><strong>How they work: </strong>This type of cash back card is very similar to a tiered category card, the main difference being that the categories change, usually each quarter. There are even cards that allow you to choose and change your own bonus category once per calendar month, like the <a href="#">Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards credit card.</a></li>
       
      <li><strong>Benefits: </strong>Rotating categories often correspond with the time of year, which can help you make the most of seasonal expenses, like holiday purchases or a summer road trip.</li>
       
      <li><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Keeping track of changing categories can be too much work for some users who then risk losing out on rewards.</li>
       
      <li><strong>Who they’re best for: </strong>If you’re fairly organized, able to follow along with quarterly category updates and can be strategic in your spending, a rotating or customizable bonus category rewards program is a great fit.</li>
       
      <li><strong>A great option: </strong>The <a href="#">Discover it® Cash Back</a>. Enroll every quarter to earn 5% cash back in a new category (on up to $1,500 per quarter, then 1%).</li>
       
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Types of cash back categories</h3>
 
<p>It’s important to choose a cash back credit card that aligns with the categories you spend on most frequently. Here are some examples:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Restaurants.</strong>Whether you enjoy dining out or take out, many cash back cards are designed with foodies in mind to maximize spending at your favorite restaurants. The Capital One SavorOne card is one of the best cash back dining credit cards, since it earns elevated cash back at restaurants.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Grocery stores and wholesale clubs.</strong>Cards that offer cash back on grocery store purchases are perfect for families or anyone that enjoys home cooking. Grocery stores and wholesale clubs are usually considered distinct categories. If you want to earn on your weekly or monthly grocery trips, one of the best cash back cards for groceries is the Amex Blue Cash Preferred or the Blue Cash Everyday.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Gas stations. </strong>Getting cash back at the pump can be especially rewarding for frequent drivers. Cards that offer cash back rewards at gas stations can be a great credit-building tool as well. Two popular cash back gas credit cards are the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express and the <a href="#">Sam’s Club® Mastercard®.</a></li>
   
  <li><strong>Retailers and drugstores.</strong>Loyal shoppers of companies like Amazon, Walmart and Target can receive cash back on online purchases when equipped with the right card. Pharmacy-goers can also benefit from cash back on prescription purchases. For cash back on drugstore purchases, the Chase Freedom Flex® is your top option.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Fitness.</strong>If you work out at a gym or fitness club membership, some cards offer cash back rewards on membership payments. For example, Discover has included gym memberships in its rotating bonus category calendar for the Discover it® Cash Back card in recent years.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Streaming and internet services. </strong>Internet service subscribers and binge-watchers of services like Netflix, Hulu and Disney+ can receive cash back rewards on their subscription payments when using certain credit cards. The Amex Blue Cash Preferred is one of these cards, since it earns 6% back on select streaming services, so it’s worth a look.</li>
</ul>

      <li><strong>High credit requirements.</strong> Most cash back cards require a good to excellent credit score (670-850 FICO).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

 
<h3>How to compare cash back credit cards</h3>
 
<p>There are several factors to consider when searching for the best cash back card. Some include how much cash back you’ll earn with each purchase, whether a card offers a 0% interest rate on new purchases or how easy it is to turn your cash back into statement credits, gift cards or direct deposits into your checking account.</p>
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cash back rates.</strong> Not all cards offer the same amount of cash back with every purchase. Some cards award more when you make purchases at the pump, while others provide bigger payouts when you use them to book hotel rooms or airline flights. The <a href="#">Chase Freedom Unlimited</a> provides 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase’s online portal and 3% on dining and drugstore purchases. If you travel frequently or spend a lot on eating out, this might be a good card for you. The <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash Card</a> earns 2% cash rewards on purchases. This card might be a smart choice if you spread your spending out each month.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Redemption options.</strong>When you want to redeem the cash you’ve earned, it’s best to have options. Some cards limit how you can use your cash back while others let you receive your cash back as a statement credit or a direct deposit to your bank account. You could also turn your cash back into gift cards or use it to shop for merchandise. With the <a href="#">Discover it® Cash Back card</a>, you can turn your cash into a statement credit, bank deposit, gift card or charitable donation. You can also shop with the cash you’ve earned at Amazon.com and with PayPal.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Intro APR offers.</strong>Some cash back cards offer an introductory 0% interest rate on new purchases, balance transfers or both. It varies, but this offer usually lasts 12 to 18 months. When the offer expires, any money you owe from a completed balance transfer and all new purchases will be subject to your card’s standard APR. With a cash back card, a 0% interest offer on new purchases is especially valuable: You’ll earn cash back but you won’t have to pay interest on these purchases during the intro period.</li>
   
</ul>

 
<h3>Cash back cards vs. travel cards: Which should you pick?</h3>
 
<p>Both cash back and travel cards are rewards cards, meaning you earn some reward for your spending: cash back or points and miles. Consider a few things if you’re trying to decide between earning <a href="#">cash back vs. points and miles</a> with a credit card.</p>
 
<p><strong>A cash back card may be best for you if:</strong></p>
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>You pay your balance in full each month</strong> Paying your balance in full each month means the cash back you earn goes straight to your bottom line instead of towards costly interest payments.</li>
   
  <li><strong>You prefer a straightforward redemption plan</strong> Cash back rewards tend to be more straightforward than travel rewards. Although the amount of cash back you earn in specific spending categories can vary, cash back rewards programs aren’t typically too complicated.</li>
   
  <li><strong>You value redemption flexibility</strong> Cash back credit cards allow cardholders to redeem earnings for statement credits, gift cards and more. A travel card often limits your most valuable redemption options to travel-related purchases.</li>
   
</ul>

 
<p><strong>A travel card may be best for you if: </strong></p>
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>You prefer extra perks when traveling</strong> A travel credit card often includes perks while traveling simply for being a cardholder. These perks can either save money or offer convenience. Benefits like a TSA PreCheck credit, free checked baggage or access to airport lounges are a few popular examples.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Travel is one of your biggest spending categories</strong> Travel reward credit cards offer the most value for travel-related purchases. If travel is one of your biggest spending categories, you can quickly rack up rewards for future travel.</li>
   
  <li><strong>You don’t mind strategizing for maximum value</strong> Often with a travel card, your greatest value will come from redeeming your earnings on travel-related purchases like airfare and hotel stays. However, you could get even more value from your points and miles by transferring them to another travel rewards program.</li>
   
</ul>
 
<h3 id="how-to-choose-a-cash-back-section">How to choose a cash back credit card</h3>
 
<p><a href="#">Comparing cash back credit cards</a>can be a daunting task, especially if you’re not sure where you spend the most or how different card types fit different lifestyles.</p>
 
<h4>What is your credit score?</h4>
 
<p>Your credit score is one of the most important factors a credit card issuer evaluates to determine your approval odds and interest rate. Cash back cards are typically issued to consumers with good or excellent credit. If your credit score falls in the bad or fair range, a better choice may be a secured, credit-builder card that helps you focus on improving your score.</p>
 
<h4>How much will the card cost?</h4>
 
<p>There are multiple fees associated with owning a credit card, and it’s important to know what these fees are so you understand the true cost of carrying one. Once you add up the fees, such as the interest rate, annual fee, balance transfer fee, and foreign transaction fees, you can weigh if the benefit of the cash back justifies the cost of using the credit card.</p>
 
<h4>What spending category is most important to you?</h4>
 
<p>Track your spending habits and determine which category you spend the most in. Once you know your top spending category, like groceries or gas, you can choose a cash back card that rewards you the most for those types of purchases. If you don’t have one stand-out category, consider a flat-rate cash back card, where you earn a specific amount of cash back no matter where you spend.</p>
 
<h4>How much time do you want to devote to your cash back card?</h4>
 
<p>Some rewards programs are more complicated than others. While cash back cards may require you to enroll in and keep track of rotating bonus categories, others may require some strategizing to maximize tiered rewards earnings. If you’re unsure of the amount of time you have to devote to a strategy, selecting a flat-rate cash back card may be the simplest approach.</p>
 
<p>Check out this example, which shows how your earnings can vary based on how much you spend and the structure of your card’s rewards program. Depending on your spending habits, you could come out on top with either a flat-rate card or a card that earns bonus rewards in a specific category.</p>

  <!-- Who should get a cash back card -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 >Who should get a cash back credit card</h3>
     
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The strategic spender.</strong> If you’re aiming to maximize cash back earnings, you can combine the strengths of flat-rate and tiered cards. With this helpful strategy, pair a credit card that offers a high rewards rate for your large, frequent purchases with a straightforward flat-rate card to cover everything else.</li>
       
      <li><strong>The minimalist.</strong> Those who strive for simplicity can see a lot of benefit from a good cash back credit card. A flat-rate cash back credit card that carries no annual fee is a great choice for someone who wants to earn rewards without much additional thought. Certain cards in this category can help you “set and forget” by automating bill payments and reward redemptions</li>
       
      <li><strong>The foodie.</strong>  Whether you love cooking meals at home or dine out on a regular basis, there are valuable cash back cards on the market rewarding your food-focused purchases by offering strong cash back offers tailored to foodies. For example, the <a href="#">Capital One SavorOne card</a> offers a generous 3% cash back on both dining purchases and grocery purchases — ideal for a night out or night in. If your food purchases skew more towards groceries, the <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</a> offers an impressive 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (up to $6,000 in purchases per year, then 1%).</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Who should skip a cash back card -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should skip a cash back credit card</h3>
     
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The luxury traveler.</strong> While cash back is relatively universal, frequent travelers may want to consider a travel, airline or hotel credit card that offers high-end perks and discounts when booking with their favorite travel brands.</li>
       
      <li><strong>The overspender.</strong>The concept of getting cash back on all or most of your purchases is enticing, but it may tempt you to spend more than necessary, especially if you anticipate carrying a balance from month to month. </li>
       
      <li><strong>The credit-builder.</strong> If you’re on a journey to rebuild or build credit from the ground up, earning cash back shouldn’t be your top priority. Cash back cards often require a good credit score and could tempt you to spend more than you normally would in order to earn cash back. Instead, focus on building credit with responsible card use.</li>
       
      <li><strong>The balance carrier. </strong>For people who tend to carry a balance or are unsure if they’ll be able to pay off a balance in full, a cash back credit card may not be the best pick. With current average <a href="#">interest rates hovering around 20 percent</a> for credit cards, it’s more expensive to carry a balance and pay interest on charges, which can quickly deplete any cash back you earn.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Pitfalls to avoid with a cash back card</h3>
 
<p>A cash back card is often a great way to earn a little something extra when you spend, but there are a few drawbacks to using one if you’re not careful. Avoid the following to ensure you continue to maximize your cash back credit card.</p>
 
<h3>Carrying balances</h3>
 
<p>Carrying a balance from month-to-month means you’re paying interest on top of whatever balance you already have. Cash back cards tend to have higher interest rates too, so this could mean a substantial amount of interest payments. If you’re paying interest each month, these charges can chip away at your earnings or wipe them out completely. Paying your balance in full each month not only keeps you from paying costly interest charges, but lets you reap the full benefit of the cash back reward.</p>
 
<h3>Mismatched spending behavior</h3>
 
<p>To avoid missing out on rewards from your cash back card, choose one where you earn the most in your highest spending categories, such as groceries or gas. Another way to avoid mismatched spending habits is to choose a flat-rate cash back card. Since this type of cash back card earns the same amount of rewards no matter where you spend, you can skip tracking top spending categories altogether.</p>
 
<h3>Missed redemption opportunities</h3>
 
<p>Some card issuers place expiration dates on cash rewards, or it’s possible you may close your account before using all your earnings. Keep a close eye on what you earn and try to redeem regularly to take full advantage of this kind of rewards card.</p>
 
<h3 id="make-the-most-of-cash-back-section">How to maximize your cash back credit card</h3>
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Match yourself with a card that best suits your spending habits.</strong> When choosing the card that works best for you, take a close look at your budget and identify where you spend most. For example, a grocery card might offer the best value if you spend substantially on groceries.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Strategize spending on bonus categories.</strong> Maximizing bonus categories can bring a boost to your rewards. Many cards release bonus categories annually or quarterly, letting you strategize where to spend.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Pair cards to fill in reward gaps.</strong> You can fill in rewards gaps by adding another card in your rotation. A travel card could help if you want more travel rewards.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Pay your balances in full each month.</strong> If you don’t, you’ll lose the rewards earned to interest. Cash back credit cards tend to carry higher APRs compared to <a href="#">low-interest credit cards</a>.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Utilize a sign-up bonus.</strong> You can receive bonus rewards by meeting the spending requirement in a certain amount of time. Ensure the requirement matches your habits to avoid losing rewards.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Check the card’s online shopping portals.</strong> Some banks offer private shopping portals for extra discounts. Check if the card offers access to exclusive savings on travel or brand discounts.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Make the most of an intro APR offer.</strong> Taking advantage of an introductory APR period is another way to maximize a card’s value, especially a 0% APR offer.</li>
   
</ul>
 
<h3>Alternatives to cash back credit cards</h3>
 
<p>Not everyone has the same financial goals, which is why some cash back cards may not be the best fit depending on what works for your particular lifestyle. Cash back is one of numerous options for rewards cards, but other cards offer benefits for travel, specific purchases and lower interest rates.</p>
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Travel cards. </strong>These credit cards offer travel rewards for purchases, which can be used towards future travel or experiences. While these cards can help reduce the cost of travel, you often need to redeem through select travel partners to receive the highest rewards value.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Student cards.</strong>Student cards are often wise options for those building or establishing their credit. Most feature no annual fees while offering incentives such as free credit monitoring or no penalty APRs.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Low-interest cards.</strong>If you tend to carry balances often, a low-interest card may be the best option. You can save a potentially large amount of money by avoiding the most costly interest charges.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Starter/credit builder cards. </strong>For borrowers with lower credit scores (500 and below on the FICO scale), these credit accounts focus on building credit from scratch and improving existing credit. The goal of opening an account of this kind is usually to improve credit over time, increasing accessibility to lower-interest, higher-reward cards with better benefits.</li>
   
</ul>
 
<h3 id="our-methodology">How we picked the best cash back credit cards</h3>
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cash back rate and categories.</strong> Of course, the best cash back credit cards make it easy to earn cash back. That’s why we chose credit cards that offer high rewards rates on common purchases.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Redemption options.</strong> What’s the use of cash back if you can’t redeem it in a way that’s valuable to you? Most cash back cards allow the option to redeem as a statement credit or even a direct deposit.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Sign-up bonus.</strong> When analyzing a credit card’s overall value, we always think long-term: ongoing rewards rate, fees, etc. But a sign-up bonus is a nice way to kickstart your cash back earnings.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Rates and fees.</strong> Here, we dug into a few costs that may cut into the card’s potential value. We avoided cards with sky-high interest rates and ensured that cardholders’ cash back would surpass any fees.</li>
   
  <li><strong>Miscellaneous benefits and features.</strong> Additional perks and benefits are rarely the main attraction, but they can be tie-breakers when comparing two similar offers.</li>
   
</ul>

      <h5>Do cash back cards actually give you cash?</h5>

    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>While you may not receive cold, hard cash itself, you can often receive rewards in the form of a paper check or a direct deposit to a designated checking account. One of the most frequently used options is a statement credit on your credit card balance, which can be used to offset past purchases.</p>
       
      <p>Read your issuer’s fine print on how and when you can redeem your cash back rewards. Some may have minimum amount requirements ranging from $5 to $25, while others allow you to redeem at any time, and for any amount.</p>

      <h5>Are cash back credit cards worth it?</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Yes. Cash back credit cards can be a great way to save money on everyday expenses. For every purchase you make with a cash back card, you’ll get a portion of your purchase back, which can add up over time. Always remember that you should never overspend on a cash back card to earn more money back, as interest charges can eclipse your earnings if you carry a balance.</p>

      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p><strong>Popular redemption options include:</strong></p>
       
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Statement credit.</strong> With this selection, the cash back reward goes toward paying down your balance.</li>
         
        <li><strong>Direct deposits.</strong> By selecting direct deposit, the cash back reward is directly deposited into your qualifying checking or savings account.</li>
         
        <li><strong>Checks.</strong> You can request a cash back reward be issued to you in the form of a check, which is sent through the mail and you are responsible for depositing.</li>
         
        <li><strong>Charitable donations.</strong> Not all card issuers give you the option to redeem points for charitable donations, but the ones offering this choice often have a list of eligible charitable organizations.</li>
         
        <li><strong>Gift cards.</strong> Redeeming cash back for a gift card could be an option, but the list of eligible merchants may be limited.</li>
      </ul>      
       
      <p>Keep in mind cardholders can also set up automatic redemptions that would automatically redeem any earnings on an annual basis, or whenever the earnings reach a certain threshold amount.</p>

      <h5>Do cash back rewards expire?</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Yes, cash back can expire. The best cash back cards often offer non-expiring rewards, but it’s not a given. With some cards, your rewards might expire after a certain length of time or after an extended period of card inactivity.</p>
       
      <p>Even cards that offer non-expiring rewards typically require the account to still be open in order to access your rewards. In other words, most cards will not allow you to redeem your cash back after you’ve closed your account.</p>

      <h5>Are cash back rewards from a credit card taxable?</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>In general, any income a taxpayer receives is subject to tax by the government. This point means the type of rewards and the way in which you receive them can be the main factor for determining whether they are considered taxable.</p>
       
      <p>In most cases, the IRS views cash back rewards to be a discount and earnings are not considered taxable income. However, sign-up bonuses that are given to you directly for just opening the account may be taxable as extra unearned income.</p>

      <h5>What credit card gives the most cash back?</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>This answer will largely depend on how you spend. Say you have a large family and you charge $250 or more each week at grocery stores. A credit card that provides more cash back for supermarket purchases might offer the most cash back. An example of one such card is the <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express</a>, which provides 6% cash back for purchases made at U.S. supermarkets (up to $6,000 in purchases per year, then 1%).</p>

      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Secured credit cards and student credit cards could be the easiest to qualify for since credit requirements for these types of cards are usually more relaxed. While you’ll typically need a good or excellent FICO credit score to qualify for the best cash back credit cards, a limited number of secured credit cards do offer cash back. The <a href="#">Discover it® Secured Credit Card</a> is one of the best examples.</p>
