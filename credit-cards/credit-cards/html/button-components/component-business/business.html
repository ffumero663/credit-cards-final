  <h2 style="font-size: 26px;" id="travel-credit-card-section" class="section-offset" >Editor’s picks: A closer look at our top-rated business credit cards</h2>
<h3>Best for simple rewards program: Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Not only will you earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on every business purchase, but you can also transfer your rewards to a qualifying<a href="#"> Chase Ultimate Rewards</a> card and boost their value by 25% when you redeem for travel. Its lack of an annual fee and generous sign-up bonus of $900 bonus cash back after you spend $6,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening are also enticing.</li>

  

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Points are only worth one cent unless you transfer them to a premium Ultimate Rewards card, plus you need a minimum of 2,000 points for redemptions.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> With <a href="#">The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express,</a> you can earn 2X points per dollar on every purchase, up to $50,000 per year (1 point per dollar thereafter). This keeps your rewards simple but more rewarding.</li>

  

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This Ink Business Unlimited card is ideal for small-business owners looking for a straightforward rewards card without complicated rotating bonus categories and spending caps.</li>

<h3>Best for cash back on office supplies: Ink Business Cash® Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> The Ink Business Cash card can help small-business owners save money on their everyday spending. The first $25,000 you spend every anniversary year will earn you the following: 5% cash back in combined purchases made in select business categories (office supply stores, as well as variable internet, cable and phone services) and 2% cash back in combined purchases made at gas stations and restaurants.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Potential cardholders may be put off by the 2,000-point minimum for redemptions and the $25,000 cap on bonus category purchases.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> If your high-spending categories tend to lean toward travel purchases, you could get more value out of the <a href="#">Capital One Spark Miles for Business</a>. It earns 5X miles on hotels, vacation rentals, and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel and 2X miles per dollar on every other purchase.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This no-annual-fee business credit card is an excellent option for owners who spend heavily within the bonus cash back categories.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for no annual fee: Capital One Spark Cash Select</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Its sign-up bonus and low potential interest rate offer cardholders many advantages, as well as the opportunity to redeem cash back earnings at any time for statement credit. That makes it easy to earn flexible rewards.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> In comparison to similar cards, this card doesn’t offer many unique business-related or travel benefits. Plus, there is no intro APR period for new purchases or balance transfers.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you prefer to have an intro APR offer on purchases, the <a href="#">Bank of America Business Advantage Customized Cash Rewards Mastercard</a> has no annual fee and offers a 0% Intro APR for 9 billing cycles for purchases (17.99% - 27.99% Variable APR on purchases and balance transfers thereafter).</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> For no annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>), this card is a great beginner business card for those who are just starting out and want to earn uncomplicated rewards on all purchases.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for sign-up bonus: Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> With the Ink Business Preferred, you’ll earn 3X points on the first $150,000 in combined purchases made on travel and in select business categories each account anniversary year. The card also touts a hefty sign-up bonus of 90,000 points after spending $8,000 within the first three months, worth $1,125 toward future travel when you redeem through Chase Travel.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This isn’t the best credit card for business owners who want to do a balance transfer or finance a large purchase since it doesn’t offer an introductory APR.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> <a href="#">The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express</a> comes with a lengthy introductory APR on purchases and earns 2X points per dollar on the first $50,000 spent on purchases each year, 1X points per dollar thereafter.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Big business spenders might want to take advantage of the Ink Business Preferred’s top-of-the-line sign-up bonus and rewards program.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for long intro APR period on purchases: The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> American Express has several credit card solutions for small businesses. For new purchases, the Blue Business Plus card offers a lengthy introductory APR from the account opening date. Plus, you can earn 15,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $3,000 in eligible purchases on the card within your first three months of card membership.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The redemption options with this card are limited since you’ll get the best value redeeming for travel. Frequent international business travelers should also note the 2.7% foreign transaction fee (<a href="#">see rates and fees</a>).</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card</a> comes with a 2% cash back rate on all purchases up to $50,000 per year (1% cash back after) and lets you redeem for a statement credit or cash back without losing any value.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Blue Business Plus credit card is another solid option for business owners looking for a no-annual-fee card or flexible financing options.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best corporate business card: American Express® Business Gold Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> Large businesses will get a lot of value out of this card – especially if they spend big in two of Amex’s six high-earning eligible bonus categories. The Amex Business Gold card automatically awards 4X points on the top two eligible bonus categories you spend the most on each billing cycle. This applies to the first $150,000 in combined purchases each calendar year (1X after that). There are also features that help manage cash flow, such as Pay Over Time.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The annual fee is a steep $375. You won’t get as much value from the Amex Business Gold card if your most significant spending falls outside the following six eligible categories: U.S. gas, U.S. dining, U.S. advertising, U.S. electronics and wireless services, and transit. And unless you plan to transfer points to airlines, you may be underwhelmed by the redemption options.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card</a> also offers increased rewards in bonus categories but comes with a lower annual fee and a bigger welcome bonus.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The American Express Business Gold Card offers plenty of benefits to business owners who spend enough to take advantage of its lucrative welcome offer and net a return on the annual fee.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for large purchases: Ink Business Premier® Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> An impressive and unlimited flat rate of 2% and the chance to earn 2.5% on every purchase over $5,000 makes this a top pick for small-business owners with larger budgets who don’t want to worry about spending caps or having to track bonus categories or those who anticipate a larger upcoming purchase.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The annual fee puts the card out of reach for small-business owners who can’t quickly offset the $195 annual fee and continue raking in cash back rewards. Plus, the benefits are limited compared to other business cards that offer statement credits, intro APR offers on purchases, or let you transfer your points to travel partners for a potentially higher redemption value.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One Spark Cash Plus</a> offers unlimited 2% cash back at a slightly lower annual fee. But if you’re looking for a business card that lets you transfer your rewards to airline or hotel loyalty programs, <a href="#">The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express</a> could be a better fit despite the spending cap on the card’s generous flat rate.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Business Premier card is a great fit for high-spending small-business owners who want to earn flat-rate rewards without worrying about spending caps. But if travel makes up a big part of your expenses, other cards could prove more rewarding.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for simple rewards redemption: The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> A cash back rate of 2% (on up to $50,000 per calendar year, then 1%) isn’t uncommon among business credit cards, but it is special when paired with no annual fee. This no-frills card also offers a 0% introductory APR (17.99% - 25.99% Variable APR) on new purchases for the first year of membership. You can also earn a $250 statement credit after you make $3,000 in purchases in your first three months.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The 2% cash back rate caps at $50,000 in purchases per calendar year (then 1%). If you plan to exceed that figure with business purchases, perhaps consider a card with a higher spending cap.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If your business makes a lot of office-related purchases, the <a href="#">Ink Business Cash® Credit Card</a> offers a higher rewards rate in that category.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> One of the <a href="#">best credit cards</a> on the market, the American Express Blue Business Cash card is a standout option for new business credit card owners whose current expenses might not justify a card with an annual fee.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for luxury travel perks: The Business Platinum Card® from American Express</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> The Business Platinum Card® from American Express is one of the best business credit cards for travel. Cardmembers get a generous welcome offer of 150,000 points if you spend $20,000 on eligible purchases in the first three months, an airline fee credit of up to $200 every year with one qualifying airline (enrollment required), airport lounge access, no foreign transaction fees (<a href="#">see rates and fees</a>) and up to a $100 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The annual fee is super high at $695, as is the spending requirement associated with the current welcome offer. Prospective cardholders should consider whether you spend and travel enough to justify these costs.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you’re not a frequent business traveler eager to turn points and miles into travel rewards booked through American Express Travel, the <a href="#">Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card</a> has redemption options that may be a better fit for you.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> With the Business Platinum Card from American Express, big business spenders who frequently travel for work can reap first-class benefits, including free airport lounge access, seat upgrades, and a 24-hour concierge service.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for fair credit: Revenued Business Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> You can qualify for the card with no hard credit inquiry and approval is based on your business revenue, not your credit score. That makes the card a solid option for small-business owners with limited credit history or an average credit score.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card’s Flex Line uses a purchase of future sales financing model. This means you can’t avoid finance charges in the way you could if you opted for a traditional credit card and avoided carrying a balance.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Consider building your credit score with a <a href="#">secured credit card</a> or a traditional <a href="#">credit card available with fair credit</a> before you look for a business-specific rewards card. Even if you have to pay an annual fee, this may end up being less than you’d face in finance charges with the Revenued Card. The <a href="#">Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> is a good starter option. You could also try for the Capital One Spark 1% Classic* business card, which is available with fair credit.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This prepaid card and credit line combo could make sense if you need business financing and can’t qualify for traditional credit cards or loans. However, its unavoidable finance charges could make it a pricey option.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Best for flat-rate cash back: Capital One Spark Cash Plus</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> Similar to the Capital One Spark Miles for Business, cardholders will earn an unlimited 2% cash back on all qualifying purchases, with no need to track spending or enroll in bonus categories, plus earn unlimited 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. Additionally, cardholders can earn a one-time cash bonus of $2,000 once you spend $30,000 in the first three months. Plus, earn an additional $2,000 cash bonus for every $500,000 spent during the first year.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Because this is a <a href="#">charge card</a>, you must pay off your balance in full each billing cycle. It also carries no ongoing APR or 0% introductory APR offers, making it less useful for those who need to free up cash flow or chip away at business expenses over time. The $150 annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and fees</a>) and high spend thresholds for the sign-up bonus could make this card too costly for some business owners.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you tend to carry a balance each month, the <a href="#">American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card</a> has a generous intro APR offer on purchases. Depending on your creditworthiness, this could be a good choice for a low-interest business credit card.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Business owners looking for a straightforward way to earn cash back on their everyday purchases will get a lot of value from the Spark Cash Plus, particularly heavy spenders, due to its flexible spending limits.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for travel: Capital One Venture X Business</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> The card’s annual travel credit, anniversary bonus miles, and comprehensive airport lounge access make it well worth the annual fee. To get access to all of these travel perks, you’ll usually have to spend around $200 more in annual fees.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Your miles are worth less when you redeem for cash back instead of travel. If you need the flexibility to redeem for cash back or travel depending on your business needs, a general rewards card may be a better fit.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If the simplicity of cash back sounds more appealing than miles, the <a href="#">Capital One Spark Cash Plus</a> is worth a look. You’ll still earn a solid rewards rate on hotel and rental car bookings via Capital One Travel, as well as unlimited 2% cash back on other purchases, all for an annual fee of just $150 (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>). It’s an especially good fit for business spenders as you can get your annual fee refunded every year you charge $150,000 or more to the card.</li>

  

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Frequent travelers should squeeze a ton of value out of this card thanks to its valuable, easy-to-use perks, streamlined rewards rates, and relatively low annual fee.</li>

<h3>Best for Hilton loyalists: The Hilton Honors American Express Business Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> The welcome offer is very generous: Earn 175,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points after you spend $8,000 in purchases on the Hilton Honors Business Card within the first six months of Card Membership (offer ends 1/8/2025). This can add up to some free hotel nights if you are <a href="#">strategic in your Hilton Honors redemptions</a>.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> There’s not much value in other redemption options beyond Hilton hotel stays.</li>

  

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The U.S. Bank Business Altitude Connect World Elite Mastercard offers a wide range of travel perks and rewards categories that may make it a better fit for travelers who are not loyal to one hotel brand.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Business owners who travel a lot or frequent Hilton hotels will generally find themselves well-served by this credit card.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for flat-rate unlimited boosted rewards: Bank of America® Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards Mastercard® credit card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> This card offers an unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases and charges no annual fee. But the real value goes to Preferred Rewards for Business clients at Bank of America or Merrill, who can get up to a 75% boost in rewards. That means cardholders could enjoy an unlimited flat rate of up to 2.62% cash back on all qualifying purchases.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Big spenders who are not existing Bank of America or Merrill Preferred Rewards clients may be better served by a card with a higher rewards rate on business-specific bonus categories.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> <a href="#">The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express</a> is a no-annual-fee business credit card that earns 2X points per dollar on all purchases for the first $50,000 spent each year and 1X points after.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Those who qualify for Preferred Rewards for Business have an opportunity to earn an impressive amount of rewards with the Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards Mastercard®.</li>

<h3>Best for rewards: Capital One Spark Miles for Business</h3>

  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> Cardholders will earn an unlimited 2X miles per dollar on all qualifying purchases, with no need to track spending or enroll in bonus categories, plus earn unlimited 5X miles on hotels, vacation rentals, and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. Additionally, there’s a welcome offer of 50,000 miles after spending $4,500 within the first 3 months.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you make a late payment, you could get hit with a higher variable penalty APR. Travelers should note that the list of partner airlines is limited, with only one domestic carrier among them.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card</a> is a strong choice thanks to its versatile rewards program that includes high bonus rewards in travel and other select business categories.</li>

 

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Consider the Capital One Spark Miles for Business if you’re looking for a flexible travel rewards card – and you spend enough to justify the $95 annual fee, waived the first year (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>).</li>

<h3>Best for businesses going back to the office: Bank of America® Business Advantage Customized Cash Rewards Mastercard® credit card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> This versatile business card has plenty to like, including its lucrative rewards rate on dining and bonus categories of your choice, such as gas, office supplies, or business consulting services. The low end of the variable APR will also be a plus for those who qualify, as well as the no annual fee.</li>

  

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This card requires excellent credit and lacks many of the perks and management tools similar business cards offer. And while there’s a lot of potential value here, not everyone will want to keep track of rotating categories.</li>

  

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Ink Business Cash® Credit Card</a> has a higher sign-up bonus and allows cardholders to earn higher rewards rates in multiple business-related categories.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If your business requires a lot of time spent on the road or long power lunches with clients, you can get a lot of value out of the Business Advantage Customized Cash Rewards Mastercard®.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Best for low interest with excellent credit: Capital on Tap Business Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The low end of the variable APR rate is impressive for a credit card, especially one with no annual fee. Depending on your creditworthiness and eligibility, you may be able to use this as a low-interest business credit card.</li>

 

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> While the card carries an impressive low-end APR, it also has one of the highest high-end APRs offered on a business credit card. Plus, Capital on Tap calls this, “The credit card built for small businesses.” But it currently doesn’t accept applications from sole proprietors who make up the majority of small businesses.</li>



  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card</a> is a flat-rate business credit card available to most small-business owners, including sole proprietors. It offers an unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases and comes with a more modest variable APR rate. Plus, you’ll earn $900 bonus cash back after you spend $6,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.</li>



  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> For a lot of small-business owners, the Capital on Tap card may not offer much value.</li>

<h3>Best for affordable travel perks: Delta SkyMiles® Gold Business American Express Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> Frequent Delta fliers can quickly rack up miles thanks to a number of perks, including a competitive base rewards program and lucrative welcome offer. Cardholders can use miles for airfare, car rentals, hotels, merchandise, and more. The miles don’t expire and there are no blackout dates.</li>

 

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> When redeeming miles, watch out for steep fuel surcharges.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The flexibility and high rewards earning potential that comes with the <a href="#">American Express® Business Gold Card</a> may be a better fit for travelers who don’t want to be tied to one airline.</li>


  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Delta loyalists will enjoy these card perks. But non-Delta fliers might want to look into flat-rate travel rewards credit cards.</li>

<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best Features:</strong> CreditCards.com referrals get 30,000 points after spending $3,500, or 50,000 points after spending $9,000 in the first 30 days. In addition to the targeted bonus rewards categories, cardholders have access to built-in expense management, automatic receipt matching, and instant virtual cards for their team. The card also integrates with QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Concur, and Expensify.</li>


  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The Brex Card is a charge card, meaning you’re required to pay your bill in full every 30 days. To be approved, you need to link a bank account containing at least $50,000 if professionally invested or $100,000 if not.</li>


  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If your startup tends to spend more in categories that fall outside of Brex’s bonus rewards categories, the <a href="#">Capital One Spark Plus</a> is a flat-rate credit card that offers up an unlimited 2% cash back on all of your purchases.</li>

<h3 id="what-are-business-cards-section">What are business credit cards?</h3>
<p>A business credit card is a revolving line of credit used by small-business owners to make purchases or withdraw cash. Like personal cards, business credit cards carry interest charges if not paid in full each month.</p>
<p>You’ll need to operate some type of business to qualify for a business credit card, but it doesn’t have to be a formal business. Here’s what you need to know about business credit cards:</p>
<h3>Who can apply for a small-business credit card?</h3>
<p>Small-business credit cards aren’t just for formal business structures like a limited liability company (LLC), corporation or partnership. They can be used by anyone trying to make a profit by selling goods or services. This includes sole proprietors, such as freelancers, independent contractors and gig-economy workers.</p>
<h3>How do business credit cards work?</h3>
<p>A business credit card helps small-business owners keep track of their credit card spending. It allows a business to free up its cash flow while purchasing necessities via credit.</p>
<p>The best business credit cards are also designed to include special features that specifically benefit businesses, such as organized expense tracking tools and spending controls, along with discounts on internet and other services needed to run a business. For the business traveler, these cards offer a slew of high-end perks from airport lounge access to upgrades. In terms of accounting, it’s advantageous to have these expenses under one business credit card account.</p>

<h3>What you should know about business credit cards</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Small-business credit cards can impact your personal credit.</strong> Most small-business credit cards will assess a <a href="#">business owner’s personal credit history</a> before approving you for a new card. Some will also report your business activity to personal credit bureaus. This could negatively impact you if you make late payments on your business credit card or run up too much debt and have a high <a href="#">credit utilization ratio</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>Small-business credit cards have fewer consumer protections.</strong> The protections that apply to consumer cards, like those that prevent excessive fees and interest rate hikes, do not apply to business credit cards. However, business credit cards will often offer similar protections as a courtesy.</li>

  <li><strong>Small-business credit cards have business-related features and benefits.</strong> The credit limits are usually higher on business credit cards than on personal credit cards. Plus, rewards and benefits are usually designed to meet the needs of small businesses. You can find discounts and rewards for office supplies, business-related travel, shipping, and other common business expenses.</li>

  <li><strong>Expect to sign a personal guarantee when applying for a small-business credit card.</strong> Nearly all business credit cards require you to sign a personal guarantee before you’re approved. A personal guarantee states that the cardholder agrees to be personally liable for the debt. This means you agree to pay back any debt even if your business fails.</li>

<h3>Types of business credit cards</h3>
<p>From secured to <a href="#">high-limit business credit cards,</a> there are plenty of options to choose from. To determine the ideal business credit card for you, you’ll need to compare credit cards to see which one provides the most value to you and your business. Here’s a breakdown of different types of cards and how they might fit your financial needs and business objectives:</p>

<div class="accordion-container">
<div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
  <h5>Cash back cards</h5>
  <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
</div>
<div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
  <p>Similar to personal cards, cash back business cards are a popular choice for business owners looking for simple ways to put money back in their pockets and maintain cash flow. Some cash back cards offer a straightforward flat rate on all your business expenditures while others have tiered rewards in different bonus categories that may be more useful if they align with your spending.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion-container">
<div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
  <h5>Travel rewards cards</h5>
  <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
</div>
<div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
  <p>If your business requires frequent travel, a business travel credit card is a great way to not only offset travel expenses but also take advantage of perks like <a href="#">lounge access and travel insurance</a>. You can often increase the value of the points you earn on these cards even more by redeeming them through issuer membership programs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-container">
<div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
  <h5>Balance transfer cards</h5>
  <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
</div>
<div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
  <p>If your business has taken on high-interest debts in the past, transferring the balance to a business credit card with a lower APR can help you manage and consolidate debt more quickly as well as save money on incurred interest while making it easier to chip away at the current balance.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-container">
<div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
  <h5>Charge cards</h5>
  <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
</div>
<div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
  <p>While they work in largely the same ways as credit cards, <a href="#">business charge cards</a> differ because they have no existing spending limit. Instead, purchases are approved based on a number of factors in your financial history, and you must pay the balance in full each month. Although the balance must be paid in full monthly, the flexibility in spending can make it easier for business owners to manage their cash flow.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
  <h5>Corporate cards</h5>
  <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
</div>
<div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
  <p>A corporate credit card is issued to employees so they can use a credit card to make authorized business purchases on behalf of the company. A small business credit card usually requires a personal guarantee, but a corporate credit card is backed by the business. The application process to obtain corporate credit cards is typically lengthier and requires the business to work directly with the credit card company to show financial documentation and possibly go through a financial audit.</p>

      <li><strong>Lucrative rewards:</strong> Businesses can benefit greatly from the rewards earned on spending, particularly on cards that offer high-value rewards rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Increase cash flow:</strong> Using a business credit card to pay vendors or suppliers can stabilize cash flow while your business is waiting for payments to come in. Plus, the cards can even be used to raise startup funding.</li>

      <li><strong>Potential for misuse by employees:</strong> Larger organizations with multiple users listed on the account may have difficulty tracking down who made what purchase and verifying the business legitimacy of that purchase.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of consumer protection:</strong> Personal credit cards come with protections against instant rate hikes and capped fees. However, these protections do not apply to business cards and mean your terms can change at any time.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="who-should-get-business-cards-section">Who should get a business credit card?</h3>
<p>Business credit cards aren’t for everyone. Before shopping among credit cards for your business, determine whether you should get one in the first place. Here’s who should and shouldn’t get a business card:</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The small-business owner:</strong> Having a card dedicated to your business is essential for tracking and managing your business expenses. Business credit cards may also have benefits that appeal to small-business owners, like free employee cards and expense tracking tools.</li>
      <li><strong>The rewards collector:</strong> The right business credit card can rack up rewards and boost your bottom line even with occasional use. Plus, any points or miles you accumulate can bring you one step closer to covering business travel expenses.</li>
      <li><strong>The employer:</strong> Most business cards allow the cardholder to order a card for an employee (or several). This means as the primary cardholder you can track, monitor and oversee the employee spending for each of the cards.</li>
      <li><strong>The side-hustlers:</strong> You don’t have to have a formal business structure, such as an LLC, to get a business card. Anyone operating a side gig, side business, or a freelance business may benefit from the repayment flexibility and expense tracking as you focus on growing your business.</li>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The debt accumulator:</strong> Your business should focus on accumulating profits rather than debt, especially when starting out. If you find yourself prone to spending more than you can afford or missing payments, you may want to avoid the risk.</li>
      <li><strong>The personal spender:</strong> To avoid a headache during tax season, personal spending is one of the <a href="#">expenses you should never charge on your business card</a>. If you plan on intertwining the two, you may encounter issues with liability and challenges come tax time.</li>
      <li><strong>The credit challenged:</strong> If you are concerned about the potential impact on your own credit score and the personal liability you may face for unpaid balances, then it may not be worth the risk.</li>

<h3 id="how-to-choose-business-cards-section">How to choose a business credit card</h3>
<p>Once you’ve determined you should get a business credit card, the next task is to choose the best business credit card that meets your needs. Here are some things to consider when choosing a business card:</p>

<div class="accordion-container">
  <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
    <h5>In what categories do you spend the most?</h5>
    <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
    <p>Business credit cards often reward business-related expenses, such as office supplies, dining, or travel. Matching a business card with the spending categories most closely aligned to your business spending can increase the card’s value and maximize the amount you’re eligible to earn in rewards.</p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-container">
    <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
      <h5>How much do you plan to spend monthly or yearly?</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Some business credit cards have spending limits for their rewards. The <a href="#">Amex Blue Business Cash card</a> earns its elevated 2% back, but only on the first $50,000 each calendar year, so spending more than $50,000 will drop the rate down to 1%. If your business spends less than that spending cap, then you could earn 2% all year. However, businesses that spend more each year or month might need cards with unlimited rewards or spending caps near $150,000 a year.</p>

    </div>
    </div>


    <div class="accordion-container">
      <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
        <h5>Do you need employee cards?</h5>
        <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
        <p>Business owners with employees may need employee cards. Employee cards allow employees to spend on the business account, bypassing the need for expense reports and reimbursements. Some card issuers charge for or limit employee cards, while other issuers offer unlimited virtual cards with custom limits for employees. If it’s important for your business to allow employees to spend with the business account, opt for a card offering low-cost or free employee cards.</p>
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-container">
        <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
          <h5>Can you afford the annual fee?</h5>
          <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
          <p>The annual fees for business cards are often higher than those for personal cards. Still, the perks and benefits may be worth it and could offset the yearly cost. Before choosing a card, consider how much value the benefits offer your business. Then, determine if it’s enough to justify the annual fee for the size and budget of your business.</p>
        </div>
        </div>


          <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
            <h5>Do you ever plan to carry a balance?</h5>
            <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
            <p>If you have an established business with a reliable cash flow, you might consider choosing a charge card above the competition. Charge cards often don’t have a set credit limit or interest rate, allowing entrepreneurs more freedom to manage expenses. You cannot carry a balance on a charge card; instead, you have to pay back whatever you charge to the card, in full, each billing cycle. This setup is ideal if you don’t want to fuss over interest rates or restrictive spending caps. However, if you’re prone to carrying balances or think you may have to carry a balance at any time, it’s best to steer clear of a charge card and opt for a more traditional business card with a low ongoing interest rate.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>How to get a business credit card</h3>
          <p>If you’ve recently opened your business or have had one for a while, you may have already started receiving offers about applying for a business credit card. Applying for a business credit card is similar to applying for a personal credit card. Here are a few steps business owners can take to get started.</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Ensure you know your credit scores (business and personal):</strong> Most banks set a minimum credit score for each credit card they offer. Knowing your business and personal credit scores will help you know what your options are. The higher your credit score, the more (and better) options you could have when applying.</li>
            <li><strong>Find the right card:</strong> Research several cards and banks and find the one that will fit with your business operations. Choosing a credit card with your current bank could help with your application process, since you already have a relationship with the bank. The types of purchases you will make on your card and the benefits you’d like to receive are also things to consider. For example, a credit card that offers high rewards rates on travel purchases could be an ideal choice if you travel frequently.</li>
            <li><strong>Gather the necessary information:</strong> When applying for a business credit card, you’ll need to provide personal information along with information about your business. Details may include your business’s name, address, employer ID or EIN number, annual revenue and number of employees. The bank may ask for more documentation during the verification process, so be prepared to supply documents regarding your business.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Once you’ve done the necessary research and have determined a credit card you would like to apply for, the next step is to apply. Most banks allow you to apply for a business credit card online. Once your application is complete, you could receive a decision within a few minutes. If your application is denied, the bank is required to send a letter detailing the reason for denial.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Business credit cards for fair or bad credit</h3>
<p>It’s possible to get a business credit card if your credit score falls outside the good-to-excellent range, but your options are limited. If you have bad credit, you may have an easier time getting approved for a secured business credit card. These cards require a security deposit, which will act as your credit limit. This could be as low as $200, and if you want that deposit back, your account will have to be in good standing at the time of closing.</p>
<p>A secured business card may not come with top-of-the-line benefits, but it lets you keep your business accounts separate from your personal spending. And in some cases, you may even be able to earn rewards.</p>
<p>For example, with the <a href="#">Wells Fargo Business Secured Credit Card</a>, you’ll earn cash back or reward points. In other words, you can choose to earn 1.5% cash back on qualifying purchases or one point per $1 spent. If you choose the reward points, you’ll get 1,000 bonus points each billing cycle when you spend $1,000 on qualifying purchases. To get the Wells Fargo Business Secured Card, you’ll have to put down a minimum deposit of $500.</p>

          <h3>How to make the most out of a small-business card</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure a sign-up bonus:</strong> Business credit cards frequently tout sign-up bonuses worth $500 or more. Sign-up bonuses reward you for spending a certain amount with your card in a set time period, usually three months. The trick is to identify a sign-up bonus within your natural spending limits. You’ll want to avoid spending more than you can ultimately pay off in full, lest you lose those extra points to interest.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Know your financing options:</strong> <a href="#">Cash flow management</a> is an important issue for most small businesses. As such, issuers often offer promotional financing or business-friendly payment terms, such as an extended payment option, which lets business owners finance large purchases over a period of time with different terms than those used for routine purchases. Know the full suite of options you have to take advantage of.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Make on-time payments:</strong> Aim to pay balances off in full each month or by the time an introductory APR expires. That way, you won’t lose any of your rewards to interest. At the very least, be sure to make all monthly payments on time. Set up auto-pay or request alerts to minimize the odds of missing a due date. Missed payments will negatively impact your credit scores and tack on additional fees.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Use your secondary benefits and features:</strong> You may get more than rewards and flexible financing with your business credit card. Some issuers offer access to expense-management tools, purchase protection, extended warranties, or certain travel insurance. You may also be able to do things like set custom limits for any authorized users added to the account. Read your <a href="#">credit card’s terms and conditions</a> to get a full scope of its benefits.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Deduct your interest and fees:</strong> You can generally deduct a portion of the interest and fees you pay on business expenses on your annual tax returns. (Note: This only applies to interest on business-related charges. If you use your business credit card for personal expenses, too, those charges aren’t eligible for a tax deduction.)</li>
            
            <li><strong>Avoid charging personal expenses:</strong> That’ll make it much easier to complete your taxes each year and regularly reconcile your books, especially since some issuers provide a breakdown of the categories you’re spending on.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Utilize employee cards:</strong> Many business credit cards allow the cardholder to add their employees as authorized users. While you will need to provide a guarantee to repay any debt for interest charges, employee cards are a great tool for earning additional rewards on behalf of the company.</li>
          </ul>
          

          <h3>Alternatives to business credit cards</h3>
          <p>A business credit card may not be the best fit for everyone. There are a few alternatives to consider if you want to explore other options.</p>
          <h3>Small business loans</h3>
          <p>A small business loan is geared toward financing a startup or small business. Entrepreneurs use small business loans to cover equipment or product costs, kickstart cash flow and finance other business-related needs. Unlike applying for a business credit card, you’ll often need to show that your business has been in operation for a set time before you’re able to apply for a small business loan. The time requirement ranges from six months to a few years. When compared to business credit cards, business loans may have lower interest rates, more flexible repayment terms and higher payout amounts.</p>
          <h3>Business lines of credit</h3>
          <p>A business line of credit provides borrowers with a pool of funds they can access as needed up to a certain limit, whereas a business or personal loan often offers one lump sum that borrowers pay back over a given loan term. Business lines of credit usually offer higher amounts of money to borrowers than what you’d get from a business credit card. You can also use a business line of credit to cover costs that business cards can’t cover, such as payroll.</p>
          <h3>Personal credit cards</h3>
          <p>A personal credit card is likely what you’d think of first when you think of traditional credit cards. These cards don’t usually provide any perks on business-specific purchases, but many do still offer competitive rewards in other categories. The best credit cards, business or otherwise, will be most accessible to people with good to excellent credit. However, you may consider steering clear of using a personal credit card for business expenses if it ends up muddying your taxes or you need a higher credit limit for pricier purchases.</p>
          <h3>Personal loans</h3>
          <p>Lenders offer personal loans to help people with many common expenses. Some examples include emergency expenses, vacations, financing for a home renovation or debt consolidation. Personal loans are the most flexible in terms of how you can allocate the funds you borrow. Personal loans often have starting interest rates that are much lower than what’s on most credit cards, and you can get higher amounts of money with a longer stretch of time to pay off the loan. Longer loan terms could also translate to more reasonable monthly payments. Keep in mind, there’s no way to avoid interest on a personal loan by paying on time; the interest is baked into your monthly payment.</p>


          <h3 id="our-methodology">How we picked the best business credit cards</h3>
<p>Research methodology: We analyzed 368 business credit cards to identify the best offers currently on the market. The major factors we considered include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rewards program:</strong> Ideally, a business credit card should reward you for the purchases your business frequently makes, whether that’s travel, office supplies or another category. We looked at whether a card offered a competitive rate of return in these spending categories as part of its base rewards program.</li>
  <li><strong>Introductory bonus:</strong> In addition to solid base rewards, we considered whether the card offered bonus points, miles or cash back in exchange for a reasonable spend within the first few months of opening the account.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexible financing offers:</strong> Many business owners use credit cards to finance large purchases, so we considered whether a specific card offered zero-interest introductory APRs on purchases and/or balance transfers. We also considered whether the card had other financing features, like a flexible credit limit.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall value:</strong> Some business credit cards do carry annual fees, so we considered whether that fee was justified by the rewards program, introductory bonus and additional benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other criteria include redemption options and flexibility, customer service, small business perks and other rates or fees. Our <a href="#">business credit card reviews</a> can help you compare offers to find the one that best suits your needs.</p>

      <h5>What is the difference between small business credit cards and corporate cards?</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>While both types of business credit cards are used to finance a business, small-business credit cards are designed for all types of small-business owners and have much fewer barriers to entry than corporate credit cards. Corporate credit cards are usually only accessible to larger businesses with millions in annual revenue and it’s typically much tougher to qualify. In addition, the debt burden always lies with the primary cardholder – the person providing the personal guarantee with a small business credit card. With corporate credit cards, liability may fall solely on the business or be shared between all authorized cardholders.</p>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Business credit cards work nearly the same as personal cards, but there are a few differences, most of which will benefit your business. Higher credit limits, business-specific reward categories, expense summaries and increased consumer protections are a few examples of the differences between a business card and a personal credit card.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>It depends on the card, but you will usually need an Employer Identification Number (EIN) to submit a business credit card application. Some applications may allow you to use your Social Security number instead, but some may ask for both numbers. If your business doesn’t yet have one, the good news is it’s free to <a href="#">apply for an EIN online</a> with the IRS and the process is quick.</p>

      <p>In most cases, you’ll need to purchase access to your credit report to get your business credit score.

      <p>Not all new businesses have the same spending needs or financial challenges. The best card for a new business will depend heavily on the individual business’s budget and highest spending categories. For example, businesses with a high office supply budget may benefit most from a card like the  <a href="#">Ink Business Cash Credit Card</a> thanks to the 5% cash back it provides when you use it to make purchases at office supply stores (up to $25,000 in purchases per year).</p>
