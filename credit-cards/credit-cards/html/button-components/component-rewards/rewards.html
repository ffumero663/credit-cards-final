      <p class="see-more-text-content">Zero-interest credit cards (or 0% intro APR credit cards) let cardholders make payments with no interest charges on purchases, balance transfers or both for a set period of time. Your entire payment (except for any fees) is applied to your balance. After the introductory period expires, you begin paying a predetermined interest rate.
        A rewards credit card offers a reward for each eligible dollar spent with the card, such as travel miles, cash back or points. These cards can offer flat rate earnings on purchases, such as 2 percent cash back across all spending categories. Or, the card may offer a boosted reward rate for select categories, like gas, grocery or travel purchases.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rewards cards often include other enticing features, such as generous welcome bonuses and cost-saving travel protections. We’ve evaluated numerous rewards credit cards to help you choose a card where you can maximize the rewards potential.

<h3>Best for sign-up bonus: Chase Sapphire Preferred Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Sapphire Preferred packs in plenty of features to justify its moderate $95 annual fee for many travelers on a budget. Tiered bonus rewards cover travel, dining and most online grocery purchases, which make it a quick rewards earner for home shoppers or those on the go. Chase also offers a 25% bonus to point redemptions when booking travel through its Travel℠ Portal. This makes the sign-up bonus even more valuable when redeemed for travel through the Chase Travel℠ portal. Because of this boost to rewards redemption, the Sapphire Preferred could provide a lot more value compared to other travel cards.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Like most travel cards, you’ll need to pay attention to which redemption options earn more or less than 1 cent per point. Redemptions other than travel through the Chase Travel℠ portal are worth up to 1 cent per point, meaning you can get a decent value for your points, but to truly make the most of your card, you’ll need to funnel redemptions through the issuer’s portal.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Few cards can match the value of the Sapphire Preferred’s sign-up bonus, but the <a href="#">Citi Strata Premier℠ Card </a>offers 70,000 bonus ThankYou® Points after spending $4,000 in the first 3 months of account opening. This is worth $700 in gift cards when redeemed at thankyou.com.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re willing to put in the work needed to get the most value, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is a great option for people looking for a low-cost, versatile travel rewards credit card.</li>

<h3>Best for flexible travel: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This easy-to-use travel card stands apart from many other travel rewards cards that come with complicated rewards programs. Plus, the big sign-up bonus, high-earning rewards and flexible redemption options add to the appeal.</li>
  
  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> It doesn’t offer bonus rewards on everyday purchases. So you could be missing out on the chance to quickly rack up rewards, especially if you spend a lot in areas like groceries, gas or dining.</li>
  
  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> For maximum travel rewards in a card with a modest annual fee, try the <a href="#">Chase Sapphire Preferred Card</a>. The annual fee is the same as the Venture card, but you can earn bonus rewards in more areas, and your points have 25% more value when redeemed through Chase Travel℠.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This <a href="#">popular Capital One credit card</a> checks all the boxes in terms of what people should look for in a travel rewards card: a competitive 2X miles back on all purchases, a generous sign-up bonus, no foreign transaction fees (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>) and up to a $120 credit to put toward the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.</li>

<h3>Best for hotel bookings: Citi Strata Premier℠ Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The annual hotel benefit (a $100 discount each year you spend at least $500 on a single hotel booking, excluding taxes and fees) is more valuable than similar credits on competing mid-tier travel cards. The card’s mix of bonus categories should also appeal to occasional travelers, as you can quickly rack up travel points even if you don’t actually spend much on travel.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you spend more on airfare than hotel bookings, this card’s 3X rewards rate on general travel and restrictive, hotel-centric annual perk may be disappointing. Citi points also carry a low redemption value compared to some competitors, based on <a href="#">Bankrate’s latest valuations.</a></li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Frequent travelers should consider the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card as it offers a high rewards rate on all travel booked via Chase Travel — not just hotels and rental cars. It also carries a more flexible annual hotel credit and valuable points (worth 1.25 cents per point when you redeem via Chase Travel — 25% more than the standard 1-cent-per-point value you’ll get from most competing cards).</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re looking to earn rewards on everyday purchases and spend enough on hotel bookings each year to take advantage of this card’s perks, it can easily be one of the best travel cards out there.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Best for restaurants: American Express® Gold Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> If you love food and travel, you’ll have a hard time finding another card that packs in such high rewards for dining, U.S. supermarkets, and flights. On top of impressive rewards rates, the card also has a great welcome offer: New cardholders 60,000 points after you spend $6,000 on eligible purchases in your first six months of card membership. Plus, receive 20% back in statement credits on eligible purchases made at restaurants worldwide within the first six months of card membership, up to $100 back (limited time offer ends 11/6/24).</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You’ll pay the price for all those benefits – namely, a $325 annual fee. Getting the most bang for your buck requires a little legwork. For instance, to maximize travel points, your best bet is to transfer them to one of Amex’s partners. So, if you’re looking for simplicity, a different travel rewards card is likely a better fit.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Citi Strata Premier℠ Card</a> is an overlooked travel rewards credit card comparable to the Amex Gold Card. But with a lower annual fee ($95 compared to $325), an annual hotel savings credit, and a generous rewards rate at restaurants, supermarkets, gas stations, and EV Charging Stations, air travel, and hotels. The Citi Strata Premier℠ Card could offer more rewards at a wider range of places depending on your spending habits.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The rewards program and annual credits found with the American Express Gold Card will make it easy for a lot of people to recoup the card’s annual fee.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Best for flat-rate cash rewards: Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Active Cash Card tops the list of flat-rate rewards cards thanks to its high 2% cash rewards on purchases and its welcome bonus, which isn’t easy to find with other no-annual-fee cards that offer a 2% flat rate.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> People who spend a lot of money in specific areas like groceries and gas may be able to earn more cash back faster with rewards cards that have bonus categories. Or, if you need more time to take advantage of an intro APR offer on purchases and balance transfers, other cards come with longer offers.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you’re willing to put a little bit more effort into maximizing your rewards, the <a href="#">Citi Custom Cash® Card</a> could be a great alternative to the Active Cash card in one category each billing cycle. If you spend modestly overall but find that either restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores, or one of the Custom Cash card’s other eligible categories makes up a large portion of your budget each month, it could offer a more rewarding balance of consistency and flexibility in one of those categories.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> For those averse to spending categories and required enrollments, the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card offers a simplified way to rack up rewards with its unlimited 2% cash rewards on eligible day-to-day purchases. Depending on how much you spend, this could quickly add up.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Best for financing travel: Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This entry-level travel card makes it easy to earn unlimited miles without worrying about an annual fee (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>). It’s also one of the only travel cards that comes with an intro APR on purchases, making it a great option if you want to chip away at the cost of a trip over time.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The rewards rate is not the best out there. Travelers can find other cards that come with no annual fee and a rewards rate that’s higher than 1.25 miles per dollar.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The Bilt Mastercard has similar features but goes further, offering rewards for rent purchases without the transaction fees, bonus rewards in multiple categories, and a chance to earn double points on all non-rent purchases on the first of every month.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The VentureOne will bring some value to the wallets of occasional travelers who want to earn travel rewards for everyday purchases without having to pay an annual fee. Cardmembers earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels and rentals booked through Capital One Travel and 1.25 miles per dollar on every other purchase.</li>

  <br>

</ul>


<h3>Best for entertainment: Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The SavorOne offers competitive cash back on popular food and entertainment categories, including dining, popular streaming services and at grocery stores (excluding superstores like Walmart and Target) and an even higher cash back rate on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. That’s a great value for a no-annual-fee rewards card (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>). Plus, the card comes with a nice sign-up bonus, if you meet the low minimum spending requirement within the first three months from account opening.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you prefer to earn rewards for essential purchases, other rewards cards earn higher rewards for grocery purchases and also offer bonus rewards in other everyday categories like gas. Plus, the exclusion of superstores decreases the card’s value for shoppers who frequently shop at places like Walmart and Target.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If your spending isn’t concentrated on dining, entertainment, or grocery stores (or at all), you can probably earn more with a no-annual-fee, flat-rate cash back card, like the <a href="#">Citi Double Cash® Card</a>.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Casual spenders who can take advantage of as many of the food-and-entertainment rewards categories will get the most value out of the SavorOne card.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Best for luxury perks: The Platinum Card® from American Express</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Platinum Card from American Express comes fully-loaded with travel benefits and credits, making it easy for cardholders looking for luxury benefits to recoup the card’s hefty annual fee. These perks include airport lounge access, multiple travel and consumer credits, and automatic elite status with <a href="#">Hilton Honors</a> (enrollment required) and Marriott Bonvoy. The card also offers one of the biggest welcome bonuses in the rewards industry.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Its $695 annual fee makes it one of the most expensive cards on the market. While the perks are plentiful, they’re not exactly straightforward. Bonus categories are subject to a cap, for instance, redemption options are a bit rigid and some of the credits come with caveats you’ll have to familiarize yourself with. Case in point: The card comes with up to $200 in Uber Cash annually, which you receive in $15 monthly increments (U.S. rides and eats) in your Uber app, along with a $20 bonus in December.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The Venture X card is one of our most popular luxury travel cards, thanks to a smaller annual fee of $395 (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>), its generous sign-up bonus, anniversary credit, and bonus miles. It offers free cards for additional cardholders (the Platinum Card charges $195 for additional authorized users) and a flexible $300 annual travel credit which can be applied to any travel purchase booked through Capital One Travel. Like the Platinum card, the Venture X offers Priority Pass lounge access and a statement credit for Global Entry or TSA Precheck.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you can take advantage of all it has to offer, the Platinum Card is worth its weighty annual fee.</li>

  <br>

</ul>


<h3>Best for annual credits: Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Venture X gives travelers a taste of luxury at a lower cost compared to other premium travel cards. On top of complimentary lounge access, annual credits, bonus miles, and a competitive rewards program, Capital One is offering 75,000 bonus miles as the card’s sign-up bonus when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening, equal to $750 in travel. This is substantial enough to help offset the card’s annual fee of $395 (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>) in the first year and give you enough excess to make travel redemptions.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Since this is a general-purpose travel card, you won’t get specific perks found with premium co-branded airline or hotel cards, like priority boarding, free first checked bag, or a free hotel night at your favorite destination.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you’re on the fence about whether you’re willing to commit to the Venture X card’s steep annual fee, the original <a href="#">Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> is well worth a look, especially if you want to earn travel rewards but don’t typically spend much on travel.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is a great travel card for those who want a premium card without the large annual fees found with other cards like The Platinum Card® from American Express and the Chase Sapphire Reserve card.</li>

  <br>

<h3>Best for pairing with Chase cards: Chase Freedom Unlimited®</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Its bonus categories and flat-rate cash back structure make it easy for people who like maximizing rewards to stockpile Chase Ultimate Rewards points.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you want this card as part of the Chase trifecta or overall travel rewards strategy, it’s not a great companion to use abroad because it charges a 3% foreign transaction fee.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternative(s):</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card</a> is another card with a similar intro APR offer and a flat rate on spending. It’s a good alternative for infrequent or inexperienced travelers because it offers straightforward rewards earning and redemption.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Chase Freedom Unlimited® is a great all-purpose card to earn elevated rewards rates on purchases and quickly boost your rewards balance.</li>


  <p>Read our full <a href="#">Chase Freedom Unlimited® review</a> or jump back to this <a href="#">card’s offer details.</a></p>
</ul>

<h3>Best for rotating bonus categories: Discover it® Cash Back</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> For no annual fee, this card offers competitive cash back, an unlimited cash-back match at the end of your first year and a lengthy promotional APR on balance transfers and purchases. Although you’ll need to manage the rotating categories by enrolling quarterly, the rewards potential on this card outpaces a number of other options. See more of the <a href="#">best zero interest credit cards</a>.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You have a little bit of legwork to do to earn your bonus cash back – namely, enrolling for the rotating categories each quarter and shifting your spending habits to maximize your earnings. Plus, the bonus categories aren’t always the same year-to-year, so you may find it harder to maximize cash back in some years versus others.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Similar to the Discover it® Cash Back, the <a href="#">Chase Freedom Flex®</a> offers generous cash back in rotating bonus categories that you must activate each quarter. On top of that, the card offers high cash back on Chase Travel℠, dining, and drugstore purchases.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Savvy spenders who can adjust their spending quarterly can really rack up rewards with this classic cash back credit card that offers tremendous potential to earn cash back on purchases in rotating bonus categories per quarter and matches all the cash back you earn at the end of your first year.</li>

  <br>

</ul>

<h3>Best for U.S. supermarkets: Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card’s high-earning tiered rewards categories provide exceptional value for households looking for ways to save on everyday essentials, including a stellar cash back incentive at U.S. supermarkets. Add in a generous welcome offer, an introductory APR on new purchases and balance transfers, and a number of purchase and travel protections, and you have a great all-around card for households.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> There’s a $95 annual fee ($0 intro annual fee for the first year). We estimate you need to spend around $3,200 a year at U.S. supermarkets to come out ahead after year one, as illustrated by our comparison between the <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred and the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express</a>.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you’re focused solely on grocery rewards, the <a href="#">Citi Custom Cash® Card</a> could be a better fit for modest shoppers. It earns generous cash back on purchases in your top eligible spend category each billing cycle (up to the first $500 spent each billing cycle) and doesn’t charge an annual fee.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Blue Cash Preferred is a <a href="#">top American Express card</a>. With its rewards rates and intro APR, this card is great for household shoppers who have a few big purchases coming up.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best second credit card: Citi Custom Cash® Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This no-annual-fee card keeps things simple by automatically earning a top-of-the-line cash back rate in one eligible spending category each billing cycle (subject to a cap each billing cycle). That long-term flexibility pairs nicely with other features of the card that provide great short-term value. Citi is also offering an attractive sign-up bonus and introductory APR on purchases and balance transfers.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You’ll pay a pricey 5% balance transfer fee (or $5, whichever is greater) if you take Citi up on its balance transfer offer. This is on the high end because many cards <a href="#">charge a 3% balance transfer fee</a> and a few <a href="#">skip the charge entirely</a>. Additionally, the $500-per-billing-cycle cap eats into the card’s value if you spend more than that each month.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> With one of the best flat cash back rates available, the <a href="#">Citi Double Cash® Card</a> is a great no-frills, all-purpose rewards card. You earn a flat cash back rate on purchases with no spending caps, unlike the Citi Custom Cash Card.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Citi card’s eligible spend categories cover a wide range of options, including travel, groceries, and home improvement stores, making it a great option that’s versatile enough to fit into any card strategy.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for gas stations: Wells Fargo Autograph℠ Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card’s broad range of practical bonus categories – all of which earn points year-round at the same generous rate – give it terrific potential as a standalone rewards card, especially for everyday travel. And since it earns bonus rewards in nearly every major spending category other than groceries, it could pair very well with a dedicated <a href="#">grocery rewards card</a>.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Even though it earns travel rewards, the Autograph Card makes a better cash back rewards card than it does a travel card. Redemption options are not as versatile when it comes to travel, and your rewards can’t be transferred to an airline loyalty program. This puts it at a disadvantage to many of the best travel cards.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> You might have to upgrade to a card with an annual fee to match the autograph’s value as a gas and transit card. The <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</a> comes with a $95 annual fee after an introductory $0 annual fee in the first year, but in return, you get exceptional value. On top of bonus rewards for your gas and transit purchases, you also get one of the highest rates around on U.S. supermarket purchases.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Autograph Card is a fantastic option for households looking to earn rewards on everyday essentials while avoiding an annual fee.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best for renters: Bilt Mastercard</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> No other cards help you avoid fees on rent payments or offer such flexible and valuable travel rewards without charging an annual fee. Thanks to its long list of airline and hotel partners and the high redemption value of its points, this card should be an almost perfect fit for long-term renters who want to score free trips.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> You can only redeem rewards toward rent payments, a future home down payment, or – if you want the best value – for travel. And though earning rewards and avoiding transaction fees on rent payments is a terrific feature, the rewards rate on that spending is low, limiting this card’s standalone value.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> This is your best option if you want to earn rewards and avoid fees on rent payments, but other cards may offer better short-term value. The Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card also offers transferable points but lets you take advantage of a generous intro APR offer and has a sign-up bonus.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you see yourself renting long term and don’t mind redeeming rewards toward living expenses or travel, this card should offer a ton of value.</li>

  <br>

  <p>Jump back to this card’s <a href="#">offer details</a>.</p>

<h3>Best for Amazon & Whole Foods: Prime Visa</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card’s rewards rate not only covers a wide array of online purchases, but also several key everyday spending categories. This makes it a terrific standalone rewards option for Amazon Prime members. You’ll also unlock exclusive pay-over-time financing options (terms apply) and Prime member deals, saving you even more.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The card’s top rewards rate only applies to purchases with Amazon and affiliated brands, so it may not be the best fit if you like to shop around for the best deal. It’s also missing a traditional intro APR offer, so it won’t be very helpful if you need to pay off non-Amazon purchases over time.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express</a> is a terrific alternative if you’re looking for a bit more flexibility. You can earn rewards on eligible U.S. online retail purchases (not just Amazon purchases) and at most U.S. supermarkets (not just Whole Foods).</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Amazon Prime members really can’t go wrong with this card, but occasional Amazon shoppers may be better off with a more flexible option.</li>

<h3>Best for customizable bonus categories: Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards credit card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> Unlike most credit cards, the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards card lets you choose your bonus rewards category. The base rewards are good for a no-annual-fee credit card and include wholesale clubs, which is a rare find for a general-purpose rewards card.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> There is a spending cap combined among the card’s bonus categories, which puts a definite damper on this rewards card. While spending caps on boosted rewards are common, combining that cap between multiple categories stunts rewards across more than one area of your spending.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you’re looking for a low-maintenance alternative to the Customized Cash Rewards card, the <a href="#">Wells Fargo Active Cash Card</a> could be a better fit. The unlimited flat rate of 2% cash rewards gives most people more chances to earn bonus rewards, and there is no spending cap to worry about.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card’s flexibility makes it worth a look even if you’re not a regular Bank of America customer. The customizable features, along with a chance to earn rewards at wholesale clubs, pair up nicely with short-term perks, including a sign-up bonus and intro APR offer on purchases and balance transfers.</li>

<h3>Best for online shopping: Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card stands out for its mix of lucrative and practical rewards categories. It not only covers staples like groceries and gas, but also purchases with select U.S. online retailers — and you aren’t limited to just one or two websites. Those three categories should cover much of the average person’s everyday spending.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> While the card offers terrific flexibility with its online shopping category, its U.S. supermarket category doesn’t cover wholesale clubs like Costco or superstores like Walmart. You can also only redeem rewards as a statement credit.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The <a href="#">Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards credit card</a> may give you a bit more flexibility. You can not only choose your own eligible bonus category each month (online shopping is just one option), but also earn bonus cash back year round at both grocery stores and wholesale clubs.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you’re looking for a low-cost card that earns cash back on everyday and online purchases, this is a terrific pick.</li>

<h3>Best for students: Capital One SavorOne Student Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The SavorOne Student card earns unlimited cash back and even has bonus categories that cover student-friendly spending areas like dining, popular streaming services, and grocery stores. It’s also one of the few student cards to offer a sign-up bonus, which could come in handy for students preparing to head back to school in the fall.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This card won’t be much help if you need to pay off a large purchase over time because it lacks an introductory APR offer. Plus, if you already have good credit or better, you may be better off applying for the non-student version of the card to benefit from its intro APR offer and sign-up bonus.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Though the SavorOne Student card offers several lucrative cash back categories, it’s hard to match the level of variety you’ll get with the <a href="#">Discover it® Student Cash Back card’s</a> rotating bonus categories. Plus, Discover will match all the cash back you earn at the end of your first year, which could make for an impressive cash rewards payday.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Capital One SavorOne Student Cash Rewards Credit Card is worth a look if you’re a student looking for a chance to build credit with responsible use while enjoying terrific cash back variety.</li>

<h3>Best for cash back beginners: Synchrony Premier World Mastercard®</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> It makes it exceptionally easy to earn and redeem rewards. You’ll enjoy a solid flat cash back rate and won’t need to stress over annual fees, rotating categories or point values.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Aside from its cash rewards, the card offers little in the way of perks, and falls behind many competitors in both short- and long-term value. Notably, it offers no sign-up bonus or intro APR — two key features that help set the best rewards cards apart.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong>Consider the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card. Though it carries a lower ongoing cash back rate (1.5% back on all eligible purchases), it comes with a chance at a generous sign-up bonus and an intro APR, which could ultimately make it a better deal overall.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong>While not the most lucrative rewards card, the Synchrony Premier can be a solid fit if you’re looking for a competitive flat cash back rate and ultra-simple redemption.</li>

<h3>Best for starter travel perks American Express® Green Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> If you’re looking for a taste of luxury travel without paying a huge annual fee, this card could strike a nice balance. Along with earning valuable, flexible Amex points, you’ll enjoy credits for Loungebuddy lounge access and expedited security screening that can offset the card’s cost on their own.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong>The annual fee may be hard to offset if you only travel occasionally or can’t take advantage of the card’s travel perks. Frequent travelers may also be disappointed by the limited lounge access privileges: Loungebuddy isn’t accepted at all airports and the credit may only cover a few lounge visits.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong>If lounge access isn’t a big priority for you, you may get more value out of the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. The Venture card only charges a $95 annual fee <a href="#">(See rates and Fees)</a>, still offers a credit for expedited security screening and carries a flat rewards rate that makes it easier to earn bonus miles wherever you spend.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong>This card carries a reasonable annual fee and solid mid-level perks, so it could be a great fit for occasional travelers interested in earning Amex points.</li>

<h3>Best for dining + no annual fee: U.S. Bank Altitude® Go Visa Signature® Card</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong>For food lovers on a budget, it won’t be easy to beat a no-annual-fee credit card that offers 4X points for your dining purchases. The card also comes with additional benefits like a welcome bonus for new cardholders and a decent annual credit for streaming services.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong>The dining rewards are this card’s top feature. But for your other everyday purchases, including gas and grocery stores, you’ll get greater value pairing this with another no-annual-fee card or even one that charges a modest annual fee.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong>The <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</a> charges an annual fee after the first year, but is loaded with value. Cardmembers earn substantial cash back at U.S. supermarkets, which makes it a great choice for cardholders who eat at home more often than at restaurants.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Anyone who eats out or orders food delivery should take advantage of the U.S. Bank Altitude® Go Visa Signature® Card.</li>

<h3>Best for GM payments and leases: My GM Rewards® Mastercard®</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong>The high rewards rate you earn on all of your purchases outshine the rate you’ll find on many other rewards cards and will go a long way to helping you save money at the GM dealership.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong>This card is only a good fit for loyal GM car drivers who want to rack up points to help bring down the cost of eligible GM-related products and services.</li>

  <br>

  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong>A general-purpose cash back card with rewards in high-earning bonus categories that fit your spending habits. Try the <a href="#">Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</a> if you want to earn an impressive amount of rewards on everyday spending.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-rewards-credit-card-section">What is a rewards credit card?</h3>
<p>A rewards credit card is a credit card that lets you earn points, miles or cash back on your spending. You might get rewards for specific types of purchases, like buying fuel at gas stations or groceries at supermarkets, or you might get a flat rate for all charges. Typically, you’ll need at least good credit to get a rewards credit card, though there are exceptions. If you’re interested in exploring some card options, our <a href="#">CardMatch tool</a> can show you what rewards credit cards you may qualify for without hurting your credit score.</p>

<h3>How do rewards credit cards work?</h3>
<p>Rewards credit cards create an exciting opportunity to earn something in exchange for using this type of credit card. What you may not realize is there are multiple ways of earning and redeeming those rewards. Different rewards cards offer different types of rewards you can earn and a few different redemption options. The two most common are travel points and miles or cash back.</p>

    <h5>How to earn</h5>
    <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Make purchases in a card’s designated bonus categories.</strong> Credit cards with bonus categories often offer these on a regular or rotating basis each quarter or year, giving you a fantastic opportunity to boost your rewards in a short period of time.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Make purchases through an issuer’s travel portal.</strong> Using the travel portal through the card issuer to make travel purchases is another tactic you can use to earn better rewards rates. These travel portals often add a boost when you purchase through them, and are one of the best ways to maximize your earning potential. For example, if you earn 2X points on travel when you book elsewhere, you could earn 5X points if you book through the issuer’s travel portal.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Use your card for daily expenses:</strong> You’re spending money anyway on everyday items, so using a credit card that rewards you for your purchases is an easy way to earn. This is especially helpful when you have a flat-rate rewards card that earns the same rate on all of your spending.</li>

      <br>
      <li><strong>Select a method of redemption:</strong> Reward cards offer a variety of redemption methods, like direct deposit to a checking or savings account, statement credits or transfers to an airline partner or membership rewards portal.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Verify your choices and redeem:</strong> It’s important to know not all redemption options have the same value, so choose a redemption option that maximizes the value if possible.</li>

    <div class="accordion-item-types-credits">
      <h5>Cash back cards</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
     <p>With a <a href="#">cash back credit card</a>, a percentage of each qualifying purchase will be paid back to you. For example, a card with a 2% cash back rate will reward you with $2 for every $100 you spend. This can be a great way to earn money for the purchases you make every day. With some cards, the rewards won’t expire for the life of the account – so the cash back that you earn will always be yours. Plus, there are several types of cash back credit cards to consider when researching.</p>
     <br>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Flat-rate cash back cards.</strong> These are the simplest type of rewards cards, offering the same rate of cash back on all purchases, usually between 1% and 2%. Flat-rate cash back cards are a great choice for someone who has a wide variety of expenses or doesn’t want to be forced to remember bonus categories. A flat-rate card can also be a good choice if you only want one credit card to use for everything. <strong>A great option: </strong> the <a href="#">  Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, </a>which offers an industry-leading flat cash rewards on purchases, plus a generous welcome bonus not typically found with a flat-rate rewards card.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Tiered cash back cards.</strong> Tiered bonus category cards reward specific spending categories, such as dining or gas, at a higher rate, while all other purchases will typically earn 1% cash back. They are a great choice for those who have recurring, significant expenses in certain categories. <strong>A great option: </strong> the <a href="#"> Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express,</a> which offers boosted cash back rewards on select U.S. streaming services, U.S. supermarkets, transit, U.S. gas stations.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Rotating category cash back cards.</strong> Similar to tiered cards, rotating category cards offer boosted rewards rates in certain categories. However, the bonus categories change, usually each quarter, and are often seasonally relevant. Those who want to capitalize on seasonal expenses, such as online shopping during the holidays or travel during the summer, might consider a rotating category card. A great option: the <a href="#">Discover it® Cash Back card</a>, which offers a substantial cash back opportunity each quarter on popular spending categories, as long as you activate the offer as required.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Cash back gives you the most flexibility with your rewards. Since you’ll typically get cash back as a statement credit or direct deposit, you can use your rewards like cash to buy anything you want. Learn <a href="#">how to redeem cash back.</a></p>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Travel credit cards reward cardholders with points or miles instead of cash. You can redeem points or miles to book travel. With some travel rewards cards, you’ll gain access to luxurious perks like airport lounge access. Among the <a href="#">best travel credit cards</a>, you’ll also find perks like free companion passes, free checked bags, TSA PreCheck credits and more. There are three main types of travel credit cards.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General-purpose travel cards.</strong> With a general-purpose travel card, you’ll earn points, sometimes on all purchases, which can be redeemed for flights or hotel stays. General-purpose cards are the most flexible type of travel credit card because they allow you to redeem with a variety of partner brands, so you’re not limited to one airline or hotel chain. Also, many general-purpose travel credit cards reward you with extra points if you redeem through the issuer-specific redemption portal, rather than transferring your points to an airline or hotel loyalty program. <strong>A great option: </strong> the <a href="#"> Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, </a>which rewards cardholders with 5X points on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3X points on dining and 2X points on other travel purchases.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Airline credit cards.</strong> <a href="#">Airline credit cards</a> reward cardholders with miles for a specific airline. You earn those miles at a boosted rate through spending on flights or other categories, such as gas stations or dining. If you’re loyal to one brand, you’ll likely find your best redemption value with an airline card instead of a general-purpose card. <strong>A great option:</strong> the <a href="#">Delta Skymiles® Gold American Express Card,</a> which offers 2X miles on Delta purchases, at restaurants worldwide and at U.S. supermarkets.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Hotel credit cards.</strong><a href="#">Hotel credit cards, </a>ike airline cards, are co-branded and encourage loyalty to a single brand. As rewards stack up, you can earn free nights and become eligible for room upgrades, free breakfast and status boosts. <strong>A great option: </strong>the <a href="#">Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card</a> that earns 12X points at Hilton properties; 6X points at U.S. restaurants, U.S. supermarkets and U.S. gas stations; and 3X points on general purchases Plus, a loyalty card like this rewards cardholders who spend $15,000 annually with a free weekend night each calendar year.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gas:</strong> <a href="#">Gas cards</a> reward you generously for each gallon you buy and sometimes only require fair credit. You can get a credit card that rewards purchases at any gas station, or one that rewards purchases at a specific gas station chain. <strong>A great option:</strong> the <a href="#">Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express</a>, which offers bonus rewards for your purchases made at the pump as well as in other everyday categories.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Sometimes called a <a href="#">co-branded card</a>, retail credit cards are a type of loyalty card tied to department stores or other store brands. These cards can offer high percentages of cash back, but the APRs can be quite high. Store cards come in two categories: closed loop or open loop. Closed-loop cards only work at the retailer whose name is on the card or at any related brands connected to that retailer. Open-loop store cards can be used anywhere that type of card is accepted. An open-loop Visa store card, for example, can be used wherever Visa cards are accepted. <strong>A great option:</strong> the <a href="#">Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature card</a>, which offers rewards on Amazon Prime and Whole Foods purchases.</li>
        <br>
      
        <li><strong>Business:</strong> <a href="#">Business credit cards</a> are designed for business owners and generally offer cash back or points on business-related spending, like office supplies or internet services, as well as money-saving perks and flexible financing benefits. <strong>A great option:</strong> the <a href="#">Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card</a>, which rewards cardholders with 1.5% cash back on all purchases for your business.</li>
        <br>
      
        <li><strong>Student:</strong> Student credit cards are specifically designed for students with little-to-no credit history. These cards typically carry low credit limits and incentives for responsible use, but can also offer enticing rewards on student-focused categories as well. <strong>A great option:</strong> The <a href="#">Capital One SavorOne Student Cash Rewards Credit Card</a>, which offers unlimited 3% cash back on dining, entertainment, popular streaming services, and at grocery stores (excluding superstores like Walmart® and Target®).</li>

    <h3 id="pros-and-cons-section">Pros and cons of rewards cards</h3>
    <p>Offers of discounted travel, complimentary hotel stays, rewards and other frills can be hard to pass up, but rewards cards aren’t a good fit for everyone. As you search for a card that best aligns with your budget and lifestyle, consider both the pros and cons of rewards credit cards.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 20px;"> 
      <!-- Pros Section -->
      <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
        <h3 style="color: #004C3F; border-bottom: 1px solid #004C3F;">Pros</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li><strong>Rewards for your everyday purchases:</strong> Rewards cards offer the chance to earn cash back, points, or miles on purchases you would likely make anyway. These rewards can be redeemed for future travel, to pay off past expenses, and more.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> Rewards credit cards often include complimentary purchase and travel protections. Extended warranty, travel insurance, and cellphone insurance coverage are a few examples of included services that provide you with both greater peace of mind and additional valuable protections while shopping or traveling.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Sign-up bonus:</strong> <a href="#">A sign-up bonus</a> offers great short-term value and quick incentive — sometimes worth hundreds of dollars — simply for using your card for a specified amount of purchases during a short time period. For example, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® card offers a 60,000 point reward, which is worth $900 in travel through Chase Travel, if you spend $4,000 in purchases the first three months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: #9B2E2E; border-bottom: 1px solid #9B2E2E;">Cons</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li><strong>High APRs:</strong> Credit card interest rates tend to be high because issuers try to lessen the risk associated with lending unsecured debt to borrowers.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>High annual fees:</strong> You may have to pay an annual fee, especially for cards loaded with perks and benefits. Make sure those benefits are worth the cost.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>There may be strings attached:</strong> Rewards may have restrictions that make it harder for you to use points and miles on your terms. Restrictions may include travel blackout dates, seat restrictions, or limits on what stores you can use for purchases to earn rewards.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Requires more work to maximize:</strong> Getting the most out of your rewards card will require some strategizing, unless you opt for a flat-rate rewards card that earns a uniform rate on all purchases. Rewards cards with bonus categories could be more lucrative, but may require tracking enrollment dates and shifting categories.</li>

          <li><strong>People who consistently carry a balance:</strong> If you’re going to carry a balance, it might be a better idea to get a <a href="#">low interest credit card</a>, which could help cut down on interest charges.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>People who want to simplify their finances:</strong> Rewards credit cards come with their own set of hassles, which could include complicated rewards programs, higher APRs, and the need to track spending caps and rewards expiration dates. For some people, these disadvantages may outweigh the advantages.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>People who skip the fine print:</strong> You’ll need to pay attention to the <a href="#">terms and conditions</a> of your rewards card. That’s where you’ll find important information, like penalty APRs, limitations, blackout date policies, and spending caps.</li>

    <h3>How to compare rewards cards</h3>
    <p>The right rewards card for you will vary depending on your financial goals and habits. So before you start comparing cards, carefully consider how you tend to spend your money.</p>
    <p>“Credit card companies offer all types of reward options these days, from points to miles to cash back, and each card provides incentives based on certain purchases or stores/retailers, so it’s important to find the card that rewards you for the purchases you make the most,” says money-saving expert Andrea Woroch, whose advice has been featured in media such as Time’s Next Advisor, Huffington Post and The New York Times.</p>
    <p>For example, a rewards rate of 3X points on travel purchases is great – but only if you regularly spend a significant amount of money on travel. The best rewards card for you will match the way you already spend. Once you know what you want – say, a card that earns travel rewards on every purchase – you’ll be able to compare rewards cards in that category. Start by considering these card features or visiting our compare <a href="#">credit cards tool.</a></p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Annual fee. </strong>There are plenty of solid rewards cards, often cash back cards, that charge no annual fee. But travel rewards cards and cards with exceptionally high rewards rates or sign-up bonuses typically do charge an annual fee. If the card you’re eyeing comes with an annual fee, you should do some quick math to make sure that your yearly rewards earnings will be greater than the cost of the fee.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Foreign transaction fees. </strong>Many travel credit cards let you skip this charge, which is otherwise imposed when you use the card overseas. Standard foreign transaction fees run between 2% and 3% of each purchase. See the <a href="#">best credit cards for no foreign transaction fees.</a></li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Additional benefits. </strong>Rewards cards often offer perks just for having the card. For example, many travel cards offer benefits like credits for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry, airport lounge access and free checked bags. If you’re torn between two cards or on the fence about whether an annual fee is worth it, perks like these can tip the scale in one direction.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Sign-up/welcome bonus. </strong>Most rewards cards offer some kind of incentive to new cardholders who spend a certain amount on their card within a specified time frame. You might get a few hundred dollars in cash back or a chunk of points you can redeem for a free flight. Though valuable, a sign-up bonus is a one-time perk. Make sure the long-term value checks out, too.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Ongoing APR. </strong>If you’ll be carrying a balance from month to month, you’re probably better off forgoing rewards and getting a low-interest credit card. That said, accidents and emergencies happen, even to those who usually pay their balance in full. Choosing a rewards card with a lower interest rate can save you money if you need to carry a balance someday. If you’re curious about how your card’s APR might affect your bottom line, read our <a href="#">guide to credit card interest.</a></li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Introductory APR. </strong>Some rewards cards offer new cardholders an introductory 0% interest rate on purchases or balance transfers for a certain number of months. These offers can be a boon, particularly if you’re planning on making a one-time large purchase or have an existing high-interest balance you’re trying to pay down. Just be sure to pay off your purchase or your balances before you focus on racking up rewards.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>First-year vs. ongoing value. </strong>Rewards credit cards with annual fees and sign-up bonuses may carry more value in the first year than in the following years as a result of welcome offers or other one-off perks. When comparing cards, consider the weight of each card’s first-year value and ongoing value. Depending on rewards rates, a card that carries a sign-up bonus in the first year may not sustain as high of a value for you as an alternative card might.</li>

    <h3 id="choosing-best-rewards-credit-card-section">How to choose the best rewards credit card</h3>
    <p>The best rewards card depends on your specific needs. <a href="#">Choosing the best rewards card</a> will come down to considering a few key questions and using the answers to lead you to the best card for you. As you look at various rewards cards, consider the following;</p>
    <h3>What type of rewards do you want?</h3>
    <p>The first step in choosing a rewards credit card is deciding what type of rewards you want most. Not all rewards cards earn in the same categories or at the same rates, and some may be more valuable than others depending on your lifestyle. For example, you shouldn’t pick a travel rewards card co-branded with an airline you never fly with, since you often won’t get the highest return on your spending. Whether you value the flexibility of cash back or want to stack up points and miles toward a trip, note the type of rewards you want most and start from there.</p>
    <h3>What are your spending habits?</h3>
    <p>Knowing where you spend the majority of your money can be helpful when choosing a rewards credit card. To get the most out of a card, you should spend highly in the categories the card rewards most generously. Take time to track your spending and get a pulse on where the money in your budget goes. Doing so will help you narrow down what rewards categories are most valuable to you, and then you can pick a rewards card that’s especially lucrative in those categories.</p>
    <h3>What are you willing to pay for?</h3>
    <p>Oftentimes, the most premier rewards cards with the best perks and benefits will charge an annual fee. You’ll need to decide how much you’re willing to pay, if anything, to hold one of these cards. Something that could help you in deciding if an annual fee is worth it is to calculate if the rewards you’d earn would easily offset the annual fee. You can find plenty of generous rewards cards that don’t charge annual fees, so this extra charge doesn’t have to push a good card out of reach.</p>
    <h3 id="maximizing-rewards-credit-card-section">How to maximize your rewards credit card</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve picked the best card for you, here are some strategies you can use to unlock your card’s full potential and maximize the value of your rewards.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Match your spending patterns with your rewards strategy. </strong>Doing so is one of the best ways to ensure you earn the most with your rewards card. For example, if you spend a lot on dining out, you’ll likely get more out of a cash back rewards card that earns highly on dining purchases than with a travel card that only earns on hotel stays or rental cars. To supercharge your earnings even more, designate your rewards card to only purchases that earn in your highest spending category. This way, you’ll ensure you’re getting maximum rewards every time.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Snag a sign-up/welcome bonus. </strong>A sign-up bonus is an ideal way to supercharge rewards, and numerous credit cards offer this incentive if you reach a certain spending threshold during the early stages of card ownership. The key is to choose one where the required spend and time frame fit within your budget. “Make sure that it’s feasible to reach the cash sign-up bonus” says Woroch, “and that you aren’t chasing the reward by making extra, unnecessary purchases.”</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Know your rewards program.</strong>It pays to read the <a href="#">terms and conditions</a> of the rewards program, which could save you from missing out on rewards opportunities. For example, the rewards program may spell out how to enroll in a quarterly bonus category or may detail the spending limit within certain categories, both of which could impact how much you are earning in rewards.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Pool points. </strong>Some issuers let you combine rewards across multiple credit cards, while others allow you to share points with family members or even friends. These options usually come with a few caveats, but they can help you reach redemption thresholds or earn big rewards, like first-class airfare, more quickly.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Take advantage of as many additional benefits as possible. </strong>Your rewards card may offer additional benefits beyond cash back and miles. Some cards offer valuable consumer protections, such as additional cellphone insurance and expanded purchase protection. Travel reward cards might include complimentary lounge access or free checked bags. Taking advantage of as many benefits as possible could save you money or make traveling easier.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Redeem for maximum value. </strong>When it’s time to redeem rewards, make sure to compare your card’s redemption options to ensure you get the best value. Credit cards typically offer several choices for redeeming rewards, but not all rewards are equal in value. For example, a reward may have a higher value when redeemed for a statement credit versus a gift card or the travel reward may be worth more if you book it through a transfer partner. Reviewing all your options before you redeem will help you select the most valuable redemption option.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Pay your bills in full. </strong> If you don’t, you’ll lose your points, miles or cash back to interest – and rather quickly, given that rewards credit cards tend to carry slightly higher interest rates than some of their counterparts. To earn rewards while minimizing the odds of overspending, consider paying your bills every week, instead of the end of every month.</li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="best-rewards-credit-programs-section">The best rewards credit card programs</h3>
    <p>You can compare individual credit cards, but knowing a little bit about each issuer’s rewards program can help you narrow your search. Credit card rewards programs come in any number of flavors, and one of them is bound to work well for you. Just remember that not every credit card from an issuer will qualify for their rewards program. Here is an overview of some popular rewards programs and how they work. You can learn more about each one by reading our full reviews.</p>

    <h3>What are points and miles worth?</h3>
    <p>The value of your points and miles can vary, depending on the card and how you redeem them. If you like to redeem your points for statement credits or gift cards, a card where your points are worth at least 1 cent is a safe bet. When redeeming for travel, your points could swing lower, but they can also go a lot higher, especially if you’re using a card with transferable points.</p>
    <p>Transferable points gives you the flexibility to move your points over to a transfer partner’s <a href="#">loyalty program.</a> This can give you more options when booking travel and give you a chance to redeem your points or miles for greater value. In some cases, the right transfer partner could bump the value of your points or miles to over 2 cents.</p>
    <p>For example, with the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, your points are worth 1.25 cents when you redeem through the <a href="#">Chase Travel℠ portal.</a> But with the right high-value transfer partner, we estimate your points could be worth an average of 2 cents.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the best credit card rewards programs that offer travel cards with transferable points:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>American Express transfer partners</li>
      <br>
      <li>Capital One transfer partners</li>
      <br>
      <li>Chase transfer partners</li>
      <br>
      <li>Citi transfer partners</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Before you apply for a new card, check to see if your points or miles can be transferred and that you’re able to transfer your rewards to your favorite airline or hotel. And to make sure you’re getting the best value, make sure you know how to do the math to see how much your rewards are worth.</p>

    <h3>How to calculate the value of your travel points or miles</h3>
    <p>When booking travel with airlines or hotels, you can see how much it will cost if you were to pay in cash or use your rewards. To find the value of your points or miles, divide the cash cost of a flight or hotel stay by the cost in points or miles. This will give you the cash value of your points or miles.</p>
    <p>You can then take a look at <a href="#">Bankrate’s latest points and miles valuations,</a>where you’ll find an estimate of what your points or miles should be worth. If the value you calculated matches or is greater than our valuation, you’ve found a good deal. But if your calculated value is less than what we estimate your points or miles should be worth, you may want to pay in cash or look for a better deal.</p>
    <p>For example, if you’re planning travel, and you see that the cost of a business class seat on a Southwest Airlines flight is $333 in cash or 23,888 points, your miles are worth 1.4 cents ($333 / 23,888 = $0.014). That’s close to our estimated value of 1.5 cents, but you may be able to do better.</p>
    <p>If you find a <a href="#">Southwest Wanna Get Away Plus</a>fare for $104 or 5,743 points, your points for that flight would be worth an impressive 1.81 cents ($104 / 5,743 = $0.018). That beats our estimate and gives you some peace of mind that you’re getting a great deal on your flight.</p>

    <h3 id="alt-to-getting-rewards-section">Alternatives to getting a rewards card</h3>
    <p>Rewards credit cards are a great way to earn free travel, cash back and more, but if you don’t have any credit history or don’t meet the requirements for most rewards cards, there are other options for you.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If you qualify, get a student credit card. </strong>Student cards are specifically designed for college students, although some may allow anyone under 21 to apply (typically with no minimum income). Student credit cards tend to offer better terms and higher limits than typical starter cards (such as secured cards), so they can be helpful for building credit history early on. The <a href="#">Discover it® Student Cash Back Card</a> is a great option to start with.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Try for a secured credit card. </strong>These cards require a security deposit, which can be as low as $200 in some cases. The amount of the deposit is usually equal to your credit limit. In exchange for the deposit, you get an account that reports positive payment history to major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion). If you want to earn rewards on everyday purchases, the <a href="#"> Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> is ideal.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Consider a retail credit card. </strong> You can get store-branded cards from major retailers like Target and Walmart. These cards offer rewards on all purchases made at the issuing store. If they are used responsibly, they can be a convenient way to build or rebuild credit.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Apply for an alternative credit card. </strong> Cards like the <a href="#"> Petal® 2 “Cash Back, No Fees” Visa® Credit Card</a> are also a good option if you don’t have any previous credit history, as they are designed for people who don’t qualify for traditional credit cards or those who may not have access to mainstream banking products.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How we picked the best rewards credit cards</h3>
    <p>We analyzed over 300 credit cards to identify the best rewards credit cards currently on the market. These factors and more inform our decisions on which cards can work the best for you.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rewards rate:</strong>We took into account rewards categories and rates, earning caps and other fine print that may affect total earnings potential.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Interest rate:</strong>Though you shouldn’t have to worry about interest rates if you’re paying your bill in full each month, we excluded rewards cards with exorbitant interest rates.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Fees: </strong>We compared each card’s fees to its rewards rate and sign-up bonus to determine whether the average consumer could earn enough rewards to justify the annual fee within the first year and years to come.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Travel benefits: </strong>For the travel cards, we’ve assessed point values and transfer partners to help you weigh your options based on your lifestyle and goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>All criteria used: </strong>Credit needed, rates & fees, transfer partners, travel benefits, point values, redemption options and flexibility, customer service, sign-up bonus, rewards rate.</p>

      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Your point-earning potential depends on two things: how much you spend on the card and whether it offers unlimited rewards. Some cards set no limit to the number of points you can earn at a boosted rate, while others might decrease your rewards rate after you hit a certain spending threshold.</p>
    </div>

      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Credit card companies use merchant category codes, or MCCs, to allocate rewards. These codes are assigned by payment networks like Visa or Mastercard, and typically apply to the business, not individual purchases. Buying a loaf of bread at a gas station would not typically register as a grocery purchase, but rather a gas station purchase. You can find a business’s merchant category code in several ways. If you’re a Visa cardholder, you can look it up online with their supplier locator tool. If your card uses a different network, like Mastercard or American Express, you’ll have to call your issuer or check your statement after making a purchase.</p>

      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>Most rewards cards require at least good credit, which is a <a href="#">FICO® score</a> of 670 or greater. With very good or excellent credit, you’ll likely have access to the best rewards credit cards. Don’t fall into either of these two categories?

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>It depends on the terms and conditions of your rewards credit card. Some credit card rewards programs will note that rewards never expire. Other programs have a defined expiration date. Additionally, it’s possible to <a href="#">lose your rewards</a> points in other ways, such as missing a monthly payment, card inactivity or violating the rewards program rules through fraud.</p>
      <p>It’s essential to check-in on your reward status throughout the year, so you are aware of any upcoming expiration dates and can plan accordingly.</p>

      <p>It depends on both the type of rewards you’re earning and the credit card you’re using. There are certain rewards that are subject to the <a href="#">taxable rules</a> from the IRS, like cash prizes, referral bonuses and welcome bonuses where there’s no spending requirement. If there’s a spending requirement tied to earning the reward, then it’s most likely not considered taxable.</p>
