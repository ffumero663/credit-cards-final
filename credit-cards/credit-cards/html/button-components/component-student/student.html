        Your college years are a time to prepare for a future career and adult life. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a great time to also establish a positive credit history. With a good credit score, you‚Äôll have an easier time qualifying for the best financial products: credit cards, car loans, a mortgage, etc. It even helps when you‚Äôre applying for a job and looking to rent an apartment.        <br>
        <br>
        One of the best ways to establish good credit is by using a student credit card responsibly. Compared to traditional credit cards, student cards may come with low credit limits and lack the best perks, but that‚Äôs okay. Student credit cards are meant to help college students build a strong credit history, which will eventually give you access to top-of-the-line credit cards.      </p>

<h3>Best for everyday spending: Discover it¬Æ Student Cash Back</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This no-annual-fee card has an intro APR, giving cardholders a potential break from interest. Also, Discover will match the cash back you‚Äôve earned at the end of your first year. Thanks to these perks, it‚Äôs no surprise that this card and the Discover it¬Æ Student Chrome are considered two top choices.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The rotating categories may not be helpful for someone just starting out because it takes a fair amount of organization to use. You have to sign up each quarter and track which categories apply for those three months.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The Chase Freedom¬Æ Student credit card not only offers students a foot in the door of Chase Ultimate Rewards but also comes with a $50 bonus after you make your first purchase within the first three months from account opening and a $20 annual bonus for the first five years for keeping your account in good standing. You‚Äôll also earn 1% back on all purchases, which you can redeem for cash back, statement credits, Apple purchases, travel, and more.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> With calculated spending, students can take advantage of strong rewards while sticking to a college budget with the Discover it¬Æ Student Cash Back.</li>

<h3>Best for cash back: Discover it¬Æ Student Chrome</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> This card comes with several perks: no credit history required, access to your FICO score, and no penalty APR for late payments. Another notable feature is the introductory APR on purchases.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> The cash back rewards in only two categories are lackluster, especially when compared to the Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards Credit Card. And even though there is no penalty APR for late payments, a late payment fee of up to $41 will apply after your first time.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> The Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards Credit Card shines as a no-annual-fee card (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>) and popular cash back categories that are student-friendly.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> With this no-annual-fee card, you‚Äôll earn 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants for up to $1,000 in combined purchases per quarter (then 1%) and 1% on all other purchases.</li>

<h3>Best for entertainment seekers: Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The 3% cash back rate on dining, select grocery stores (excluding superstores like Walmart¬Æ and Target¬Æ), popular streaming services, and entertainment is not only super generous for this card category, but it also fits students‚Äô common spending habits. Plus, students will enjoy consumer-friendly terms like no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>).</li>
  
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> If you don‚Äôt spend money on the card‚Äôs bonus categories, you‚Äôll probably be better served by a flat-rate student rewards credit card. Students will also need to watch out for the high APR.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If you get a kick out of strategizing about when and where you buy to maximize rewards, the Discover it¬Æ Student Cash Back card‚Äôs unique cash back program could be right up your alley.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Students who are already spending on dining, entertainment, and streaming can reap ample rewards with the student version of this popular Capital One credit card, which offers a best-in-class return on non-rotating bonus categories among student credit cards.</li>

<h3>Best for earning rewards + avoiding fees: Petal¬Æ 2 ‚ÄúCash Back, No Fees‚Äù Visa¬Æ Credit Card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> You‚Äôll immediately earn 1% cash back on every eligible purchase. After making six on-time payments, that rate grows to 1.25% for eligible purchases, followed by 1.5% on all eligible purchases once you make 12 on-time payments. There are even select merchants where you can earn anywhere from 2% to 10% cash back.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> Your credit limit can be as low as $300. With a limit that low, even carrying over a balance of $100 could impact your <a href="#">credit utilization ratio</a> and credit score. Paying your balance in full each month will help ensure you stay on a positive credit-building course.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> If your goal is to build credit with low qualification requirements, the <a href="#">Discover it¬Æ Student Chrome</a> is a well-rounded, rewarding option.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Petal 2 is a great option if you‚Äôre trying to build credit. This unsecured credit card doesn‚Äôt require a deposit and has a fast preapproval process, which will not affect your credit score. Plus, it comes with no annual fee, late payment fee, foreign transaction fee, or penalty APRs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best for sign-up bonus: Chase Freedom¬Æ Student credit card</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> It has a $20 Good Standing Reward with which cardholders receive 2,000 points (or $20) after each account anniversary year for their first five years if their account is in good standing (meaning their minimum payments are being made on time). Additionally, this card comes with no annual fee, a relatively low APR, and access to a free look at your credit score each month.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> While the base rewards earnings (1% cash back on general purchases) are good, there are a few student credit cards that could net you more cash back, depending on your spending habits.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Like the Freedom Student, the <a href="#">Journey Student Rewards from Capital One</a> card offers 1% cash back on every purchase. With the Journey, however, cardholders can boost their cash back for any month to 1.25% when they pay their bill on time.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Chase Freedom Student is one of the rare student credit cards to offer a sign-up bonus. New cardholders earn a $50 bonus after their first purchase is made within the first three months after account opening.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best for Amazon Prime: Deserve¬Æ EDU Mastercard for Students</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Best features:</strong> The Deserve EDU Mastercard is a solid option to help build your credit history. Like our other top picks, it comes with no annual fee, plus other perks like no foreign transaction fees, no credit history needed, price protection, travel assistance, extended warranty, and ID theft protection.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Biggest drawbacks:</strong> This card‚Äôs 1% cash back on all purchases can be easily beat by its competitors. Also, there‚Äôs no introductory APR offer or cash sign-up bonus.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Students looking for a student card with attractive perks should look at the Chase Freedom Student credit card, which offers perks like a complimentary 3-month DoorDash membership when activated by 12/31/2024 and an account anniversary bonus.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This card offers some benefits that are hard to come by. For instance, an intriguing sign-up bonus of one year of Amazon Prime Student after spending $500 in the first three billing cycles (lifetime value of $59). This is a unique feature for the student who buys textbooks on Amazon.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-a-student-card-section">What is a student credit card?</h3>
<p>Student credit cards are designed for college students who want to start building credit. They differ from traditional credit cards in many ways. For example, student cards may lack large sign-up bonuses and high credit limits. But the credit requirements will usually be lower for a student card, and these cards will sometimes have special features specific to the needs of college students. These can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Late payment forgiveness</li>
  <li>No penalty APRs</li>
  <li>Automatic credit limit reviews</li>

      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>The annual percentage rate is the interest that issuers charge on balances carried from month to month.  It‚Äôs usually determined by your credit score, so cardholders with higher scores often receive lower interest rates. That said, the best way to avoid interest is to pay the balance in full every month.</p>
      <p>Penalty APRs can come into effect when minimum payments are not met. Penalty APRs are usually the highest interest rates credit cardholders will experience.</p>

      <p>A credit limit is the maximum amount that an issuer or financial institution will extend to a cardholder. For most student credit cards, the limit is $1,000 or less.

      <p>Many credit cards, student cards included, offer rewards. Rewards include cash back, points, and sign-up bonuses. Cash back is simply a percentage of the charges you make credited back to your account. Rewards points can usually be redeemed for travel, gift cards, statement credits, and more. Reward miles are like rewards points and cash back but are typically redeemed for flights, hotels, or rental cars.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual fees: </strong>Though most student credit cards do not have annual fees, many rewards cards typically do. This fee is usually $50 to $500.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance transfer fees: </strong>These fees can run 3% to 5% or $5 to $10, whichever is greater.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash advance fees: </strong>Cardholders can pull cash from their credit card at an ATM, usually with an extremely high APR.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign transaction fees: </strong>Typically about 3%, these can cut into your rewards while traveling for breaks or study abroad, so check for this.</li>
        <li><strong>Convenience fees: </strong>Occasionally charged by the merchant, you can end up paying about 3% for using a credit card to pay rent or tuition.</li>

<h3 id="pros-and-cons-section">Pros and cons of student credit cards</h3>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 20px;"> 
  <!-- Pros Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 style="color: #004C3F; border-bottom: 1px solid #004C3F;">Pros</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Low barriers of entry:</strong> Most student cards are open to almost all levels of credit scores, but you might have to provide proof of income to get approved. Student cards allow young and inexperienced cardholders to build credit, spend conveniently, and get into the routine of the right habits.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Don‚Äôt lose out on rewards:</strong> Typically, cards for new credit users and bad credit scores come with low value rewards or no rewards program at all. With student credit cards, you can enter the world of credit cards while still earning worthwhile cash back rates.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Student-centric benefits:</strong> Many student credit cards feature things that the college-aged cardholder would appreciate, such as credit-building perks and no annual fee. Some cards even reward high-traffic student spend categories, such as supermarkets, dining purchases, entertainment, and Lyft rides.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Cons Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 style="color: #9B2E2E; border-bottom: 1px solid #9B2E2E;">Cons</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Pricey APRs:</strong> Carrying a balance could be costly for a student cardholder. Because student cards are able to provide options for so many and still give substantial rewards, there‚Äôs some additional interest cost if you don‚Äôt pay in time or fully.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Lack of bonuses:</strong> Student cardholders can still capitalize on Discover‚Äôs Cashback Match offers, but most student cards come without large sign-up bonuses or any other money-saving treat.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Ability to overspend:</strong> For rookie cardholders with an easy new way to spend, it‚Äôs essential that basic concepts of budgeting are instilled. Many college students aren‚Äôt used to managing their own bills, so it may take some planning and practice to be sure that payments don‚Äôt become too steep.</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Who should get a student credit card</h4>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 20px;">
  <!-- Who should get a student credit card -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should get a student credit card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The shopping student.</strong> If you‚Äôre spending on textbooks, food, clothes for school, or anything else regularly, a student credit card could be a great help. Student cards aren‚Äôt strangers to cash back rewards, so you could earn some money back when you swipe your card on campus. While a small percentage back may not seem like a major impact, savings add up over time and will help when it comes time to make monthly payments.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The student saver.</strong> Homebody students and those on a limited budget have lots of advantages with a student credit card. Opening a credit card account while in college is a great way to establish your credit score and managing your payments with just a few purchases each billing period is an easy way to start strong.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The new cardholder.</strong> These cards are often more generous than other <a href="#">cards for low credit</a> and come with credit-building perks, so it can be an ideal way for students to get started if you qualify.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Who should skip a student credit card -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should skip a student credit card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The rewards chaser.</strong> Although student credit cards feature worthwhile rewards rates and bonus rewards in certain categories, an experienced cardholder would find more value out of a high-end card. If <a href="#">today‚Äôs top rewards cards</a> are out of your range, the options here are a great way to grow your credit and earn along the way.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The traveler.</strong> Students vacationing and studying abroad will appreciate cash back rewards and the lack of foreign transaction fees that student cards can bring to the table, but a more typical traveler likely wants more. If you‚Äôre looking to turn purchases into future trips and improve your travel experience, reroute to the <a href="#">best travel cards</a>.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The tight-budget student.</strong> If you‚Äôre already dealing with debt from student loans, textbooks, or any other expense, it might be best to wait on applying for a student card. Credit cards are useful tools to grow credit, spend conveniently, and earn rewards, but they can escalate into a major burden if you can‚Äôt afford to pay off your purchases and fall behind schedule.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<h3 id="maximizing-student-card-section">How to make the most of your student credit card</h3>
<p>When used responsibly, a student credit card is a phenomenal tool for building your credit history. Just remember as a college student, it‚Äôs imperative that you‚Äôre on top of your spending and know what it takes to stay on track financially. Here are some good tips to keep in mind to avoid common mistakes and to make the most of your student card:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pay your balance in full each month.</strong> This is one of the most important habits to establish as a new cardholder. When you pay off your balance each month it helps your credit score and prevents interest from accumulating.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Track your spending.</strong> Use your card for small everyday purchases like gas and groceries. Some cards offer tools like spending trackers, but there are also apps that you can download to keep track of where you have room to spend more and where you need to cut back. You can also set alerts that will notify you when you‚Äôre close to reaching your monthly spending limit.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Know your rewards.</strong> Whether your card comes with heightened rewards in certain categories, rotating rates, or a flat-rate rewards program, it‚Äôs important to know how you earn. Be sure to use your card whenever you‚Äôre spending in a well-rewarding category to get the most out of your purchases.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Budget.</strong> You need a budget and a limit for emergencies when they inevitably happen. It‚Äôs important to avoid spending recklessly and to plan out a certain amount each month for emergencies, so if something does happen, you won‚Äôt be left with an unexpected balance you can‚Äôt pay off.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Be responsible with your payments.</strong> Set up a system in which you pay the same time every month, like a bill. Autopayments can be extremely helpful if available, and some cards offer a monthly reminder to pay on time. If your card doesn‚Äôt offer these features, designate a day and time each month to pay off your balance.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Last but not least, <a href="#">check your credit score and credit reports</a>.</strong> You can access your credit reports for free each year through AnnualCreditReport.com, and you can access your credit score through MyFICO.com for about $20 each. Also, some cards offer the feature of free access to your credit score.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="what-to-do-on-graduation-section">What should you do with your student credit card when you graduate?</h3>
<p>Credit cards can be extremely useful tools for earning you cash or points rewards every time you spend. More importantly, they are one of the fastest ways to achieve a great credit score, unlocking doors to new opportunities. If you are preparing to graduate this year, you‚Äôll likely want to think through your credit and credit card. Should you add a card? Maybe lose the card you have? And what do these actions do to your credit? Here‚Äôs what we have to say about that.</p>
<p>Unless the card has an annual fee, there is pretty much no reason to get rid of the credit card, and even then, you want to make sure there are no benefits to counterbalance getting rid of the card. In fact, <a href="#">holding onto the card may help your credit score.</a> The biggest change you might want to make is to increase your credit limit. Once you start your new job out of college or have set a trend of being a responsible cardholder, contact the card issuer and ask. With your new salary, you should get a sizable increase, which helps with your available credit if you have a balance.</p>
<p>Additionally, check with your card issuer and see if you qualify for an upgrade that will allow you to keep your credit history. You might be able to graduate from a 1% cash back card to a 1.5% cash back card, for example. Just make sure it‚Äôs an upgrade and not a new account so that your history continues to grow. Also, there should be no hard inquiry if it‚Äôs an upgrade.</p>


<h3>Credit card tips for parents with college students</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways to help your kids build their credit, from making them an authorized user to just sharing a few valuable tips.</p>

<h3>Make your student an authorized user</h3>
<p>The easiest and fastest way to build credit is with a credit card, but that can be a tough nut to crack for consumers under 21 years old. Luckily, there‚Äôs a way to help your student improve their credit relatively easily ‚Äì <a href="#">make them an authorized user</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="#">authorized user doesn‚Äôt have to be 18</a>, which means you could give your underage teen a card, depending on the card issuer. Make sure the card issuer will report to all three major credit bureaus for her credit files. Some don‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt make sure of this, then her credit may not benefit.</p>

<p>While your student will benefit from your credit habits, they‚Äôre not responsible for the balance. Ensure that you have good credit and keep paying your bills on time so that she benefits. Understand that when they are removed from your card, it drops off their credit files. Because of this, it may be better to get them a separate card from the beginning.</p>

<h3>Teach them proper card use</h3>
<p>If you and your student feel they‚Äôre ready for a credit card, it‚Äôs a good idea to establish some ground rules to help develop healthy credit habits.</p>

<p>Find ways to make them responsible for their spending. You can have a system in which they pay you at the same time every month, like a bill, and encourage them to pay the full balance. You can also have them track their spending and tell you when it reaches a certain amount during the month and help set up alerts, so they know when approaching their monthly limit.</p>

<p>Another good tip, to ensure they have a place in their budget for emergencies, is to set a credit limit for that specific purpose. Also, show them how to check their credit score and credit reports. They can access their credit reports for free each year through <a href="#">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> and can access credit scores through <a href="#">MyFICO.com</a> for about $20 each.</p>

<h3>Teach your student about budgeting</h3>
<p>Having a budget will give students a better understanding of where their money goes. It will also empower them to make better money-management decisions.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to teach a student how to create a budget. You can use spreadsheets or a budget calculator. Or you can automate the process and use a <a href="#">budgeting app</a>. These tools save a lot of time, especially when you use one that syncs to your bank accounts and credit cards. When you use a budgeting app that links to your accounts, they can track your income and expenses. They may even break your spending down into categories and automatically set money aside in a savings account.</p>

<h3 id="our-methodology">How we picked the best student credit cards</h3>

  <li><strong>Credit-building perks:</strong> Credit cards for students are best utilized when establishing a good credit score. We made sure the cards here have benefits that will help students get into the right habits and will report those habits to the three major credit bureaus.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Because students and rookie cardholders are often on a tight budget, we searched for cards that avoided an annual fee, have reasonable terms and don‚Äôt hit you with extraneous costs.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Student benefits:</strong> Many student cards come with incentives specifically designed for college-goers. We looked for unique perks, rewards rates in applicable categories and other benefits that‚Äôll help out around campus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our full criteria include:</strong> Regular APR, foreign transaction fee, sign-up bonus, credit needed, rewards rates and categories, redemption options, ease of application, customer service, security and miscellaneous benefits.</p>

      <p>Your options may be more limited, but yes, international students can get a credit card. Not many of the cards here are eligible to international students, but the Deserve EDU Mastercard for Students is a great option for a student studying abroad in the United States thanks to it not requiring a credit history. Cards like this and other <a href="#">options for international travel</a> are a savior for those in need of a way to pay.</p>

      <p>To get a student credit card on your own, you must be at least 18 years of age. That being said, in accordance with the Credit CARD Act of 2009, anyone under 21 must be able to provide proof of independent income to be approved for a card. Also, with assistance from a parent or guardian, you could potentially start building credit before the age of 18 by becoming an authorized user.</p>

      <p>If your application for a student card is unsuccessful, don‚Äôt immediately apply for another. When an application gets denied, the provider must notify you to explain why. If their notification doesn‚Äôt point you in the right direction, you should review your credit report for any errors or major demerits. Students should then look into taking the <a href="#">steps to improve their credit</a>, or look to other <a href="#">cards for bad credit</a>, like secured options.</p>

      <p>Before the age of 21, students will have to provide proof of income in order to be approved for a credit card. With that said, the income requirements for a student card aren‚Äôt predetermined and your proof of income doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be from a traditional job. In certain circumstances, a student could be approved for a card without a consistent paycheck coming in.</p>
