<h2 style="font-size: 26px;" id="gas-details-section" class="section-offset" >Editorâ€™s picks: Gas credit card details</h2>
<h3>Blue Cash PreferredÂ® Card from American Express: Best for family spending</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> The Blue Cash Preferred Card is one of the most lucrative cards on the market thanks to its exceptional cash back program. With so many high-earning spending categories, it makes the daily grocery runs, the gas station visits, and even the family binge-watching sessions that much more rewarding.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> No other card offers such high earnings at U.S. supermarkets, and the earnings on U.S. gas stations are more than competitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> This card has one of the highest annual fees youâ€™ll find on a gas credit card. Also, the heightened cash back rewards are only available in the U.S.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> Family shoppers who cook at home and frequent commuters might want to start bringing this card along on their errands thanks to its generous cash back.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> Someone who spends time on the road but isnâ€™t a supermarket shopper should explore their other options here â€“ there may be a more fitting rewards structure for a lower annual fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Blue Cash PreferredÂ® Card from American Express review</a>.</p>


<h3>Discover itÂ® Chrome: Best for no annual fee</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> Ideal for the cardholder with good or excellent credit, this card offers a decent rewards rate without an annual fee holding back your rewards.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> The Discover itÂ® Chrome gives you all the benefits of the Discover itÂ® Secured Credit Card â€“ 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants (up to $1,000 in combined purchases quarterly, then 1%) â€“ without the need for a security deposit. This card also gives you the opportunity for a lower ongoing interest rate than the Discover itÂ® Secured Credit Card.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> This card earns its best cash back rate only on your first $1,000 in quarterly spending across restaurants and gas stations. Depending on how much you spend in these categories each year, this may be a low cap.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> If you spend a lot of time on the road or dining out, this card offers a solid flat cash back rate with no annual fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> Credit builders who donâ€™t yet have the credit score for the Discover itÂ® Chrome are better off getting started with the Discover itÂ® Secured Credit Card and growing their score over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our <a href="#">Discover itÂ® Chrome review</a>.</p>

<h3>Discover itÂ® Student Chrome: Best for students</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> It can be difficult to find a student credit card that offers a rewards rate as high as this cardâ€™s. This card charges no annual fee and offers 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants for up to $1,000 in combined purchases per quarter (then 1%) and 1% on all other purchases. Plus, all the cash back you earn is matched at the end of your first year thanks to Discoverâ€™s Cashback Match welcome offer.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> This card comes with several benefits: no credit history required, access to your FICO score, no APR changes for late payments, and an introductory APR offer on purchases.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> While ideal for a consumer just starting out, this is a card you will outgrow rather quickly. There is no penalty APR for late payments, but a late payment fee of up to $41 will apply after the first time you pay late.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> This card is a great choice for any student building credit. Thanks to high-traffic categories, useful perks, and matched first-year cash back, the Discover itÂ® Student Chrome might be the best student card out there.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> Being a student card, this option isnâ€™t one of the best cash back cards for people with a good or excellent credit score.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costco Anywhere VisaÂ® Card by Citi: Best for electric vehicles</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> This cardâ€™s cashback rate for eligible gas purchases is not only one of the best out there, but it also applies to electric vehicle charging stations.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> While several rewards cards offer a grocery bonus category, they usually exclude wholesale clubs like Costco from earning bonus rewards. This card not only earns 2% back on Costco purchases but also includes boosted rates for restaurant and eligible travel purchases, making it a solid everyday rewards option.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Thereâ€™s no annual bonus, as well as no sign-up bonus, and youâ€™ll need to pay the $60 annual Costco membership fee to avoid an annual fee with this card.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> Costco members and those who spend a lot of time on the road can benefit greatly from this card.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> Anyone opposed to becoming a Costco member wonâ€™t be able to utilize this card. On top of the membership requirement to be a cardholder, your cashback certificate must be redeemed at Costco.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Credit One BankÂ® Platinum X5 VisaÂ®: Best for credit-builders</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> This Credit One Bank credit card offers an impressive rewards program, which can be hard to come by on cards available to people with fair credit. While this card charges a high annual fee, its impressive rewards rate on everyday purchases can quickly offset its cost.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> This card offers an exceptionally high rewards rate in practical everyday categories like eligible groceries and gas, making it a great standalone rewards option for credit-builders.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Like many unsecured <a href="#">credit cards for fair credit</a>, the X5 Visa comes with a high annual fee and APR, which could make it a risky pick if youâ€™re new to credit cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> People with fair-to-good credit who may not qualify for a top-tier rewards credit card may enjoy this cardâ€™s blend of rewards and credit-building features.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> If your annual budget in this cardâ€™s bonus-rate categories easily exceeds the $5,000 annual spending cap, you should look for one that can consistently reward your purchases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards Credit Card: Best flat-rate rewards for fair credit</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> This card could be an ideal option if you donâ€™t want to keep track of rotating categories and would rather earn a flat-rate cash back on all purchases.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Youâ€™ll earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases, no matter the category. Also, the QuicksilverOne typically accepts consumers with fair credit, which is handy if you are trying to improve your credit and you also want to earn rewards.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> This cashback card has an annual fee of $39 (<a href="#">See rates and Fees</a>), which eats into your overall rewards earnings. Youâ€™ll need to spend at least $2,700 each year to break even. Also, the cardâ€™s variable APR is high, so carrying a balance could be costly.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> Those with fair credit who still want to earn cashback rewards are a good fit for this card.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> Shoppers who spend most of their money in one or two categories might have more to earn with a rotating categories card or one that heightens rewards in a particular field.</li>

<h3>Citi Rewards+Â® Card: Best for bonus points</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> The Citi Rewards+Â® Card offers a unique rewards rate that makes it easy to rack up those bonus points. With the Citi ThankYou points rate, even the smallest everyday purchases, like a cup of coffee or a tank of gas, have the potential to be very rewarding.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Not only do you get 2X points at gas stations and supermarkets (on up to $6,000 each year, 1X thereafter), but the sign-up bonus you can earn is top-notch. Youâ€™ll earn a 20,000 point bonus after a $1,500 spend in the first three months (redeemable for $200 in gift cards at thankyou.com). Plus, as a special offer, earn 5 ThankYouÂ® Points per dollar spent on hotel, car rentals, and attractions (excluding air travel) booked on the CitiTravel.com (offer ends 12/31/25). Your rewards are always rounded up to the nearest 10 points â€“ meaning a $1.29 pack of gum is worth a full 10 points. Also, youâ€™ll get 10% of your points back on the ThankYou points you redeem for up to 100,000 points per year.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> The intro balance transfer fee is 3% or $5 (whichever is greater) for balance transfers completed within the first four months of account opening, and there is a foreign transaction fee of 3%. Also, your travel redemption is limited to only the ThankYou Travel Portal.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> Those looking for a straightforward rewards program for their everyday purchases might want to consider the Citi Rewards+. Also, if you find yourself making lots of small purchases, the round-up feature might be a great way for you to earn extra points.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> If youâ€™re someone whoâ€™s shy about using your card, this probably isnâ€™t the right choice for you. The unique rewards structure of the Citi Rewards+ is designed to help shoppers capitalize on every purchase, no matter how small.</li>

<h3>Discover itÂ® Secured Credit Card: Best for limited credit history</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> The Discover itÂ® Secured Credit Card offers high rewards and generous benefits. It also gives you tools that can help you stay on track financially, all the while maximizing your savings.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Along with offering ongoing rewards at gas stations and restaurants, this card will match all the cash back youâ€™ve earned at the end of your first year of card membership. You may also be eligible to transition to an unsecured line of credit and have your deposit returned after seven months of responsible card use.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> There is a minimum security deposit of $200 to open this account, which may be more than you want to tie up as you build credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> The Discover itÂ® Secured Credit Card might be the best of its kind, offering easy access, generous rewards, and tools to build your credit score. Those with limited credit looking for a secured option to get started should look no further.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> If you canâ€™t afford the $200 minimum security deposit, the Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card might be a better fit for you. Depending on creditworthiness, you may be able to get a card with a starting limit of $200 with as little as $49 down.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My GM RewardsÂ® MastercardÂ®: Best for GM rewards</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> The My GM Rewards Card earns an incredible amount of points: 7X points on eligible purchases made at GM and 4X points on all other purchases. These points get the greatest value when you put them toward the purchase or lease of a GM vehicle or buy GM products and services.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> On top of the high rewards, this card has no annual fee and comes with quite a few nice perks. These include a sign-up bonus of 15,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 in the first three months of account opening and a $100 statement credit back on $1,500 of fuel at eligible gas stations per calendar year (upon activation).</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> This card offers very little flexibility when it comes to redemption options. One point is worth one cent when redeeming for GM products and services (100,000 points = $1,000). Beyond that, points can be redeemed for gift cards, but the redemption value drops significantly, and one point is only worth $0.0025 (100,000 points = $250).</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> Loyal GM fans and anyone thinking about buying a car in the near future will want to consider adding this card to their wallet so they can begin saving up points.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> You wonâ€™t get a lot of value out of this card if youâ€™re not in the market for a car and willing to stick with a GM vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Samâ€™s ClubÂ® MastercardÂ®: Best for gas rewards anywhere</h3>
<ul class="bullet-point">
  <li><strong>Why we picked it:</strong> This card offers a whopping 5% cash back on gas purchases (up to the first $6,000 per year) anywhere, meaning youâ€™re not limited to only filling up at Samâ€™s Club fuel stations. Cardholders also earn 3% cash back on dining and 1% cash back on other purchases, with a maximum of $5,000 cash back per year.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Youâ€™ll receive a small account opening offer: a $30 statement credit if you spend $30 in Samâ€™s Club purchases within 30 days of account opening. Thereâ€™s no annual fee, though a $45 Samâ€™s Club membership is required. Plus, as a nice surprise, there are no foreign transaction fees, a benefit highly uncommon among store-branded credit cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> You can only put rewards toward Samâ€™s Club expenses or statement credits, unless you redeem for cash back at the wholesale retailer. Moreover, you only receive rewards once a year in February, and those rewards expire if you donâ€™t redeem them by Dec. 31 of that same year. Youâ€™ll also lose rewards if your Samâ€™s Club membership lapses before February.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should apply?</strong> Samâ€™s Club shoppers can take advantage of a best-in-class return on gas purchases without restrictions on where they fill up.</li>
  <li><strong>Who should skip?</strong> Although you donâ€™t have to fill up at a Samâ€™s Club to get rewarded, youâ€™ll want to be in the vicinity of one if youâ€™re a carrier of this card. Rewards can only be used for Samâ€™s Club expenses or statement credits unless you redeem for cash at a physical Samâ€™s Club location.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-a-gas-credit-card-section">What is a gas credit card?</h3>
<p>Gas credit cards earn points, cash back, or miles on special rewards for gas purchases. The best gas rewards cards also offer bonus rewards in other categories, like groceries or dining.</p>

<p>Thanks to so many gas cards approving cardholders with fair or worse credit scores, these cards can also open a lane to rewards for all types of consumers. There are even specific <a href="#">gas cards for bad credit</a>. If you spend lots of time with your foot on the pedal, why not cut the cost of fueling up?</p>

<h3>How do gas credit cards work?</h3>
<p>Gas credit cards are often easy to apply for online, although credit requirements can vary depending on the type of gas card youâ€™re considering. Your score will impact the available cards in your pool, but nearly anyone can find a way to earn rewards with a gas card.</p>

<p>Depending on the card you carry, there may be some slight differences in how you earn rewards. Some gas cards let you earn points or cash back for each dollar you spend on gas and other purchases, yet closed-loop gas cards that only work with a specific gas brand may offer a discount for each gallon of gas you buy instead.</p>

<p>The benefits of picking up a gas card depend largely on the card you get approved for and their specific rewards program. Just remember that, like all credit cards, these cards charge interest when you carry a balance, so youâ€™ll want to pay your statement balance in full each month you use it. Getting familiar with the various types of gas credit cards available will help you make an informed choice.</p>

<h3 id="types-gas-cards-section">Types of gas reward cards</h3>
<p>There are three types of gas credit cards:</p>
<ol>
  <li>General-purpose credit cards with gas rewards programs</li>
  <li>Co-branded gas credit cards</li>
  <li>Private label gas credit cards</li>
</ol>

<h3>General-purpose credit cards with gas rewards programs</h3>
<p>General rewards credit cards come from traditional issuers like <a href="#">American Express</a> and <a href="#">Capital One</a>. These cards either offer rewards in specific categories (like supermarkets and gas stations) or <a href="#">flat-rate cash back</a> on all eligible purchases â€“ including gas bought at any gas station you visit.</p>

<p>These cards are a great choice for cardholders who make purchases at a variety of gas stations and want to consolidate their rewards or cash back rates in multiple categories into a single card.</p>


<h3>Co-branded gas credit cards</h3>
<p>Co-branded gas credit cards are offered by specific gas stations (like Shell or BP) that team up with traditional credit card networks like <a href="#">Mastercard</a> and <a href="#">Visa</a>. You can use these types of gas cards at any gas station, but they may only earn discounts or rewards when used at gas stations owned by the specific brand. They are a way to encourage customers to stay loyal to one brand of gas.</p>

<p>If you make a habit of only buying your gas from one particular brand, a co-branded gas credit card may be enough for you. But for anyone else, it makes more sense to stick with a general-purpose gas card. That way, you can always be assured youâ€™ll earn rewards at any gas station you visit.</p>

<h3>Private label gas credit cards</h3>
<p>This type of gas credit card isnâ€™t a part of any credit card network. Itâ€™s a store-branded card that you can only use at gas stations affiliated with the specific brand offering the card.</p>

<p>Private label gas credit cards are a good option for people with <a href="#">bad</a> or <a href="#">fair credit</a>, as they are easier to qualify for. But most will not have as many perks as a traditional rewards card. So people with good or excellent credit should look to co-branded or general-purpose gas credit cards.</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 20px;"> 
  <!-- Pros Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 style="color: #004C3F; border-bottom: 1px solid #004C3F;">Pros</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Savings:</strong> Many gas rewards cards come with no annual fee, allowing you to save upfront and not have to worry about hitting a certain amount of spending to make your card worthwhile. Plus, your gas card may offer sign-up bonuses, rewards, or discounts, giving you a chance to earn cash back or reduce how much you pay at the pump.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Widespread availability:</strong> The best rewards credit cards are usually reserved for people with good or excellent credit. But some gas credit cards often allow for credit scores in the fair (580 to 669) or even poor credit range (300 to 579). This is a chance to improve your credit while earning rewards.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Additional rewards:</strong> Many gas cards offer a chance to earn rewards in additional categories like supermarkets and dining. The best gas credit cards come with rewards across several categories. With the right card, you can earn points or cash back on all of your eligible everyday spending.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Cons Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 style="color: #9B2E2E; border-bottom: 1px solid #9B2E2E;">Cons</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The fine print:</strong> To earn gas rewards, you may have to jump through some hoops. Some gas cards may limit your rewards rate to certain brands of gas stations, may only earn gas rewards during certain months of the year, or could have limits on how much you can spend in a certain period of time. Make sure you are aware of the <a href="#">terms and conditions</a> of your credit card before applying.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Lack of welcome offers:</strong> Many gas credit cards donâ€™t provide any bonus rewards for early spending or 0% intro APR periods. If your credit score allows it, you can find sign-up bonuses and other first-year offers, but most gas cards here fall short on these incentives.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The interest rates:</strong> Depending on your credit score, your specific APR could be at the high end of the gas credit cardâ€™s APR range. That means your interest rates could be upwards of 20%. A <a href="#">low-interest credit card</a> could be a better fit for you if you donâ€™t make a point to pay your credit card bills in full on time.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Who should get a gas card Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should get a gas card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The road warrior:</strong> When a good chunk of your life is spent driving from one place to another â€“ be it commuting to work, picking up and dropping kids off, or just hitting the open road â€“ a gas card is for you.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The family shopper:</strong> Gas credit cards can help people manage the family budget. You can find rewards at the supermarket, on meals out and takeout, internet, streaming services, and more, to add on top of your gas rewards.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The credit builder:</strong> Several gas cards allow for lower credit scores and give people the chance to earn rewards as they work to grow their credit. Just remember that earning rewards doesnâ€™t mean you should overspend, and being sure you regularly pay off your monthly balance in full is the most important step in <a href="#">improving your credit score</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Who should skip a gas card Section -->
  <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3>Who should skip a gas card</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>The frequent flyer:</strong> Gas cards typically reward in the form of cash back and donâ€™t provide bonus rates on travel purchases. Even if a gas card does have points-earning or allows you to redeem rewards for travel, it likely wonâ€™t be as impactful as a <a href="#">travel rewards card</a> would be.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The debt consolidator:</strong> Someone who has an outstanding balance in a high APR account is a prime candidate for a <a href="#">balance transfer credit card</a>, but unfortunately you wonâ€™t find the longest 0% intro APR offers for balance transfers on gas cards.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>The eco-friendly driver:</strong> If you drive a hybrid or an electric vehicle, your gas bills likely arenâ€™t high enough to rationalize a gas credit card. A general <a href="#">cash back card</a> or another category-specific <a href="#">rewards card</a> will provide you much more value.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="maximizing-gas-section">How to make the most of a gas rewards card</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
  <li><strong>Know your terms:</strong> Some cards limit your bonus spending to a specified amount each quarter, so you may want to mark your calendar to make sure you fill up at the end of each period if you havenâ€™t hit the threshold. Plus, if your card is a rebate card, there may be certain incentives for spending in the first 30-, 60-, or 90-day window. If thereâ€™s bonus savings available, planning your card around a road trip or move could be a great way to take advantage.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Donâ€™t forget the additional rewards:</strong> Top gas cards give rewards in other categories, so diversifying your spending might be essential to taking full advantage of your card. You shouldnâ€™t spend just to spend, but knowing where your card earns a little extra can save you in the long run.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Make timely payments:</strong> Getting your balance paid on time and in full is one of the essentials of any credit card, but especially with gas cards. Some cards come with high APRs that can put you in the fast lane to expensive bills.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Secure your sign-up bonus:</strong> Some gas cards feature sign-up bonuses or first-year cash back incentives. Being certain to hit the spending requirement or purposefully maximizing your first-year cash back are great ways to squeeze value out of your card.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Map out your routes:</strong> If your card limits you to particular gas stations, plan out your stops ahead of time. GPS apps on your phone can make this easy, plus apps like <a href="#">GasBuddy</a> can help you sort through locations, brands, and prices as you search.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Whether a gas rewards credit card requires fair credit or good credit varies. For example, a card that demands brand loyalty may accept fair credit, while a general-purpose cash back card that rewards for a number of categories (including gas) may require good or even excellent credit.</p>
      <p>Here are some credit ranges for different types of gas rewards cards, with examples:</p>

      <p>In short, yes. It should be. That doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re for everyone, but if you spend enough time on the road that gas purchases make up a substantial amount of your budget, you should get value out of a gas credit card.

Even if your card does come with an annual fee, the available rewards should have no problem exceeding its cost.</p>

    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>A general-purpose rewards card offers a lot of value for the average gas spender thanks to the cash back rewards you reap across multiple categories. But which one will depend more on your spending habits.</p>

      <p>For supersized gas savings, youâ€™ll want to check out the <a href="#">PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa SignatureÂ® Card</a> (5 points per dollar on gas purchases) and the <a href="#">Samâ€™s ClubÂ® MastercardÂ®</a> (5% cash back on up to $6,000 in gas purchases each year, then 1% back). These are some of the highest cash back rates for gas, and each card offers additional bonus categories that can help grow your rewards.</p>

      <p>The <a href="#">Costco Anywhere VisaÂ® Card by Citi</a> offers 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases (first $7,000 in purchases per year, 1% thereafter). Those rewards grow if your normal spending falls into other bonus categories offered by this card (restaurants, eligible travel, Costco purchases).</p>

      <p>The <a href="#">Blue Cash PreferredÂ® Card from American Express</a> rewards cardmembers with an unlimited 3% back at U.S. gas stations every year. That rate isnâ€™t as high as the other cards mentioned, but thanks to Amexâ€™s generous welcome offer and higher cash back bonus categories (U.S. supermarkets and select U.S. streaming services), your rewards earnings could easily soar past the competition.</p>

      <h5>Is a gas card better than a credit card?</h5>
      <span class="accordion-icon-types-credits">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-panel-types-credits">
      <p>A traditional rewards credit card is more versatile and generally offers a better deal than a gas card. Why? Rewards cards may offer enhanced perks, including sign-up bonuses and cash back â€“ not just for gas but for multiple bonus categories. Private label (or closed-loop) gas cards typically offer per-gallon discounts. Unfortunately, these <a href="#">gas brand cards lose their value as gas prices rise</a>.</p>

      <p>Rewards credit cards with the best perks typically require good or excellent credit. If you have less-than-stellar credit, you may have an easier time qualifying for a gas card than you would a traditional rewards card or a credit-building card that also offers rewards. If thatâ€™s the case, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with taking advantage of owning a gas card. The right <a href="#">gas rewards program</a> may even have increased rewards for its most loyal members. Just keep in mind you may have to jump through some hoops, and youâ€™ll need to stick with that particular gas brand to truly see any savings.</p>

      <p>One example is the <a href="#">Shell Fuel Rewards</a> program, which offers gas savings on every fill-up at Shell stations as well as a chance to earn additional discounts on gas based on purchases you make at participating restaurants, Shell stores, online shopping, event tickets, and rental cars.</p>
